# RepoDataset

 Repository metadata as dataset

## Usage

Using the jupyter notebook to explore the Insitutionl Repository metadata dataset.

We provide three examples to explore the dataset:

* `repodataset.ipynb`: Publication types, and top publishers.
* `gettext.ipynb`: Download the text version of the PDF, or save the URLs to a text that can be downloaded with commands like `wget` or `curl.`
* `vosviwer.ipynb`: Export certain fields to [Vosviewer](https://www.vosviewer.com/), like _abstract_ or _authors_. There is an option to plot the map using all fields, but it takes several minutes to create the plot.
