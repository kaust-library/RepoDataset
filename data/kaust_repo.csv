The temporal growth of cracks can be monitored in order to predict impending failures of materials or structures such as a weakened dam. Thus, cracks and their spatial-temporal distributions should be automatically monitored for assessing their structural integrity, the associated stress patterns and their potential for failure. Method: We show that the U-Net convolutional neural network, semantic segmentation and transfer learning can be used to accurately detect cracks in drone photos of sedimentary massifs. In this case, the crack distributions are used to assess the safest areas for tunnel excavation. Compared to the coarse performance of ridge detection, the U-Net accuracy in identifying cracks in images can be as high as 98% when evaluated against human identification, which is sufficient for assessing the general crack properties of the rock faces for the engineering project. Result: Based on approximately 100 h of manual cracks labeling in 127 drone photos and 20 h of network training, the U-Net was able to successfully detect cracks in 23,845 high-resolution photographs in less than 22 h using two Nvidia V100 GPUs. Meanwhile, the network was able to detect more than 80% of the observable cracks of a volcanic outcrop in Idaho without additional training. With a modest amount of extra labeling on photos of the volcanic outcrop and transfer training, we found that the accuracy significantly improved. The surprising outcome of this research is that the U-Net crack detector laboriously trained on photos of sedimentary rocks can also be effectively applied to photos of volcanic rock faces. This can be important for real-time assessment of geological hazards and lithology information for dam inspection and planetary exploration by autonomous vehicles. For another application, we accurately detected fractures and faults with a scale of tens of kilometers from Martian photographs. Conclusions: In summary, our methodology of using CNN with transfer training suggests that it can be used as a semi-universal detector of cracks in across a range of diverse geological settings.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/691064/1/feart-11-1073211.pdf,,2023-04-12T15:40:08

This study focuses on determining the reaction rates and thermodynamic properties of methoxy radical reactions with five gasoline fuel components: n-heptane, iso-octane, 1-hexene, cyclopentane and toluene. Electronic structure calculations were performed for all the stationary points with M06-2X/6−311++g(d,p) method. G3 composite method with atomization method is used for determining ΔfH0 of all the closed shell and radical species, using which the necessary thermodynamic data of all the species was determined. Coupled cluster theory QCISD(T)/cc-pVXZ (where X = D and T) and Møller–Plesset perturbation theory MP2/cc-pVXZ (where X = D, T and Q) were used to calculate single point energies. Subsequently, rate constants for all hydrogen atom abstraction channels have been performed using conventional transition state theory with unsymmetric tunneling corrections. A systematic comparison of rates for abstraction from different sites within the same species and same site from different species is done in order to get insights into this reaction class. The computed thermodynamic properties and rate constants were incorporated in to a recent gasoline mechanism to investigate the impact of the calculations performed in this work.

However, the stability of RuO2 in PEMWEs has remained poor due to the over-oxidation of under-coordinated lattice oxygen (O) and the consequent formation of O vacancies (Vo) at high oxidation potentials under acidic corrosive conditions. Here, we report an oxyanion protection strategy to prevent the formation of Vo on the RuO2 surface by forming coordination-saturated lattice O. Combining density functional theory calculations, electrochemical measurements, and a suite of operando spectroscopies, we showcase that barium (Ba)-anchored sulfate can greatly impede Ru loss and extend the lifetime of Ru-based catalysts during acidic OER while maintaining the activity.

Recently, many frameworks for machine unlearning have been proposed, and most of them focus on image and text data. To extend machine unlearning to graph data, \textit{GraphEraser} has been proposed. However, a critical issue is that \textit{GraphEraser} is specifically designed for the transductive graph setting, where the graph is static and attributes and edges of test nodes are visible during training. It is unsuitable for the inductive setting, where the graph could be dynamic and the test graph information is invisible in advance.

Recently, however, there has been a trend towards evaluating the robustness of these models against adversarial attacks. This involves assessing the accuracy of VQA models under increasing levels of noise in the input, which can target either the image or the proposed query question, dubbed the main question. However, there is currently a lack of proper analysis of this aspect of VQA. This work proposes a new method that utilizes semantically related questions, referred to as basic questions, acting as noise to evaluate the robustness of VQA models. It is hypothesized that as the similarity of a basic question to the main question decreases, the level of noise increases. To generate a reasonable noise level for a given main question, a pool of basic questions is ranked based on their similarity to the main question, and this ranking problem is cast as a LASSO optimization problem. Additionally, this work proposes a novel robustness measure, R_score, and two basic question datasets to standardize the analysis of VQA model robustness. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed evaluation method effectively analyzes the robustness of VQA models.

The goal is to identify the optimal regularizer within a family depending on a parameter in a general topological space. Our focus lies on the situation with non-compact parameter domains, which is, for example, relevant when the commonly used box constraints are disposed of. To overcome this lack of compactness, we propose a natural extension of the upper-level functional to the closure of the parameter domain via Gamma-convergence, which captures possible structural changes in the reconstruction model at the edge of the domain. Under two main assumptions, namely, Mosco-convergence of the regularizers and uniqueness of minimizers of the lower-level problem, we prove that the extension coincides with the relaxation, thus admitting minimizers that relate to the parameter optimization problem of interest. We apply our abstract framework to investigate a quartet of practically relevant models in image denoising, all featuring nonlocality. The associated families of regularizers exhibit qualitatively different parameter dependence, describing a weight factor, an amount of nonlocality, an integrability exponent, and a fractional order, respectively.

However, optical devices based on NPLs still suffer from nonradiative Auger decay of multiple excitons (MX), which limits the efficiency of the processes, including MX luminescence, electroluminescence, and optical gain. Here, we demonstrate that Auger recombination is strongly suppressed in spherically shaped nanoplatelets, called quantum shells (QSs), where a relaxed confinement of charges leads to diminished exciton–exciton interactions. In particular, we use single photon counting and photon correlation spectroscopy to show that two-dimensional CdS/CdSe/CdS core/shell/shell spherical QSs reach near-unity biexciton emission yield. The Auger suppression was found most prominent in QSs with the largest shell diameter. A combination of ultralong (>15 ns) biexciton (BX) emission lifetimes and strong exciton–exciton repulsion in these QS samples allowed demonstrating low-threshold amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), large modal gain, and microcavity lasing featuring sharp emission modes at the BX and MX transitions.

The principle of this method is based on the swelling of non-porous UHMWPE film in organic solvent at elevated temperatures, followed by its cooling and further extraction of organic solvent, resulting in the formation of the porous membrane. In this work, we used commercial UHMWPE film (thickness 155 μm) and o-xylene as a solvent. Either homogeneous mixtures of the polymer melt and solvent or thermoreversible gels with crystallites acting as crosslinks of the inter-macromolecular network (swollen semicrystalline polymer) can be obtained at different soaking times. It was shown that the porous structure and filtration performance of the membranes depended on the swelling degree of the polymer, which can be controlled by the time of polymer soaking in organic solvent at elevated temperature (106 °C was found to be the optimal temperature for UHMWPE). In the case of homogeneous mixtures, the resulting membranes possessed both large and small pores. They were characterized by quite high porosity (45–65% vol.), liquid permeance of 46–134 L m−2 h−1 bar−1, a mean flow pore size of 30–75 nm, and a very high crystallinity degree of 86–89% at a decent tensile strength of 3–9 MPa.

In this work, we apply multimodal operando UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy coupled with an online mass spectrometer and ""mobility-dependent"" solid-state NMR spectroscopy to better understand the reaction mechanism over zeolites H-Beta and Zn-Beta. Significantly, the influential co-catalytic role of oxymethylene species is linked to gasoline formation, which impacts the MTG process more than carbonylated species.",,Published,,,2023-04-12T11:10:08

Recent cryo-EM reconstructions of high-fidelity DNA polymerase Pol δ (Pol δ), translesion synthesis DNA polymerase κ (Pol κ) and Ligase 1 (Lig1) bound to a DNA substrate and PCNA demonstrate that the critical interaction with PCNA involves the internal PIP proximal to the catalytic domain.

This is achieved by developing a novel use of an iron salt (i.e., FeCl3) in an integrated anaerobic wastewater treatment and mainstream anammox process. FeCl3 was chosen to be dosed in a proposed sidestream unit rather than in a primary settler or a mainstream reactor. This causes acidification of returned activated sludge and enables stable suppression of nitrite-oxidizing bacterial activity and excess sludge reduction. A laboratory-scale system, which comprised an anaerobic baffled reactor, a continuous-flow anoxic–aerobic (A/O) reactor, and a secondary settler, was designed to treat real domestic wastewater, with the performance of the system comprehensively monitored under a steady-state condition. The experimental assessments showed that the system had good effluent quality, with total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations of 12.6 ± 1.3 mg N/L and 0.34 ± 0.05 mg P/L, respectively. It efficiently retained phosphorus in excess sludge (0.18 ± 0.03 g P/g dry sludge), suggesting its potential for further recovery. About half of influent organic carbon was recovered in the form of bioenergy (i.e., methane). This together with low energy consumption revealed that the system could produce a net energy of about 0.11 kWh/m3-wastewater, assessed by an energy balance analysis.",,Published,,,2023-04-12T10:50:09

Viral predation pressure on coral reefs. BMC Biology, 21(1). https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-023-01571-9","Background: Predation pressure and herbivory exert cascading effects on coral reef health and stability. However, the extent of these cascading effects can vary considerably across space and time. This variability is likely a result of the complex interactions between coral reefs’ biotic and abiotic dimensions. A major biological component that has been poorly integrated into the reefs' trophic studies is the microbial community, despite its role in coral death and bleaching susceptibility. Viruses that infect bacteria can control microbial densities and may positively affect coral health by controlling microbialization. We hypothesize that viral predation of bacteria has analogous effects to the top-down pressure of macroorganisms on the trophic structure and reef health. Results: Here, we investigated the relationships between live coral cover and viruses, bacteria, benthic algae, fish biomass, and water chemistry in 110 reefs spanning inhabited and uninhabited islands and atolls across the Pacific Ocean. Statistical learning showed that the abundance of turf algae, viruses, and bacteria, in that order, were the variables best predicting the variance in coral cover. While fish biomass was not a strong predictor of coral cover, the relationship between fish and corals became apparent when analyzed in the context of viral predation: high coral cover (> 50%) occurred on reefs with a combination of high predator fish biomass (sum of sharks and piscivores > 200 g m−2) and high virus-to-bacteria ratios (> 10), an indicator of viral predation pressure. However, these relationships were non-linear, with reefs at the higher and lower ends of the coral cover continuum displaying a narrow combination of abiotic and biotic variables, while reefs at intermediate coral cover showed a wider range of parameter combinations. Conclusions: The results presented here support the hypothesis that viral predation of bacteria is associated with high coral cover and, thus, coral health and stability. We propose that combined predation pressures from fishes and viruses control energy fluxes, inhibiting the detrimental accumulation of ecosystem energy in the microbial food web.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/691044/1/s12915-023-01571-9.pdf,,2023-04-12T10:40:09

The prominent effects of the immunosenescence process is the thymic involution and, consequently, the decreased numbers and functions of T cells. Since thymic involution results in a collapse of the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, a reliable biomarker of its activity is represented by the quantification of signal joint T-cell receptor rearrangement excision circles (sjTRECs) levels. Although it is reasonable to think that thymic function could play a crucial role on elderly survival, only a few studies investigated the relationship between an accurate measurement of human thymic function and survival at old ages. Methods and findings: By quantifying the amount sjTRECs by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the decrease in thymic output in 241 nursing home residents from Calabria (Southern Italy) was evaluated to investigate the relationship between thymic function and survival at old ages. We found that low sjTREC levels were associated with a significant increased risk of mortality at older ages. Nursing home residents with lower sjTREC exhibit a near 2-fold increase in mortality risk compared to those with sjTREC levels in a normal range. Conclusion: Thymic function failure is an independent predictor of mortality among elderly nursing home residents. sjTREC represents a biomarker of effective ageing as its blood levels could anticipate individuals at high risk of negative health outcomes. The identification of these subjects is crucial to manage older people's immune function and resilience, such as, for instance, to plan more efficient vaccinal campaigns in older populations.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/691043/1/s12979-023-00340-0.pdf,,2023-04-12T10:00:14

However, the effects of boosting on mixing, combustion and emissions in existing studies are inconsistent. In this paper, the mixing, combustion and emission characteristics with intake pressures of 100–400 kPa at low, medium and high loads are studied. The results show that the increase of intake pressures is conducive to the enhancement of air entrainment, while the air utilization ratios are reduced, thus requiring injection pressure to be optimized to effectively improve the mixing. For the intake pressures of 100 kPa, the average chemical reaction path is low-temperature reaction route, while the path of higher intake pressures is dominated by high-temperature pyrolysis. For soot emissions, when the equivalence ratio is lower than 0.175, the oxygen in the cylinder is sufficient, so the effect of temperature decrease is more significant, which leads to the increase of soot emissions with the increase of intake pressures. Otherwise, the effect of increasing oxygen concentration is more significant, so soot decreases accordingly. When the peak of global temperature is lower than 1800 K, the effect of the increase of oxygen concentration is more dominant, so the NOx emission increases with the increase of intake pressures.

While they have been mostly used to accelerate deep learning training and inference models for machine learning, HPC scientific applications do not seem to directly benefit from these specific hardware features unless AI-based components are introduced into their simulation workflows, for instance, as a replacement of their numerical solvers. This paper proposes to take another direction in an attempt to democratize customized AI architectures for HPC scientific computing. The main idea consists in demonstrating how legacy applications can leverage these AI engines after a necessary algorithmic redesign. It is critical that the resulting software implementations map onto the underlying memory-austere hardware architectures to extract the expected performance. To facilitate this process, we promote the matricization technique for restructuring codes (1) by exploiting data sparsity via algebraic compression and (2) by expressing the critical computational phases in terms of tile low-rank matrix-vector multiplications (TLRMVM) and batch matrix-matrix multiplications (batch GEMM). Algebraic compression enables to reduce memory footprint and to fit into small local cache/memory, while batch execution ensures high occupancy. We highlight how we can steer the Graphcore AI-focused Wafer-on-Wafer Intelligence Processing Units (IPUs) to deliver high performance for both operations. We conduct a performance benchmarking campaign of these two matrix operations that account for most of the elapsed times of four real applications in computational astronomy, seismic imaging, wireless communications, and climate/weather predictions.

We studied herein the topological effects on the static and dynamic properties of a 2D catenated network of DNA rings called a kinetoplast. Restriction enzymes that cleave DNA at sequence-specific sites are used to selectively cut and remove rings from the network and hence tune the molecular topology while maintaining overall structural integrity. We find that topology has minimal effects over the spatial extension of the 2D network; however, it significantly affects the relaxation behavior. The shape fluctuations of the network are governed by two distinct characteristic time scales attributed to the thermal fluctuations and confinement of the network. The relationship between the time constant of thermal relaxation and the amplitude of anisotropy fluctuations yields a universal scaling. Interestingly, this scaling is independent of the detailed arrangements of rings and/or perforation within the catenated networks.

Thus, the distance between the triangles indicates their degree of dissimilarity. K-means clustering uses this distance and sorts of segments into k classes. After this, remeshing is applied to minimize the distance between triangles within the same cluster by making their shapes identical. Clustering and remeshing are repeated until the distance between triangles in the same cluster reaches an acceptable threshold. We adopt a curvature-aware strategy to determine the surface thickness and finalize puzzle pieces for 3D printing. Identical hinges and holes are created for assembling the puzzle components. For smoother outcomes, we use triangle subdivision along with curvature-aware clustering, generating curved triangular patches for 3D printing. Our algorithm was evaluated using various models, and the 3D-printed results were analyzed. Findings indicate that our algorithm performs reliably on target organic shapes with minimal loss of input geometry.",,"Under Review",https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690988/1/2304.02941.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690988/2304.02941.pdf.txt,2023-04-10T16:00:11

Previous works attempt to generate videos in arbitrary lengths either in an autoregressive manner or regarding time as a continuous signal. However, they struggle to synthesize detailed and diverse motions with temporal coherence and tend to generate repetitive scenes after a few time steps. In this work, we argue that a single time-agnostic latent vector of style-based generator is insufficient to model various and temporally-consistent motions. Hence, we introduce additional time-dependent motion styles to model diverse motion patterns. In addition, a Motion Style Attention modulation mechanism, dubbed as MoStAtt, is proposed to augment frames with vivid dynamics for each specific scale (i.e., layer), which assigns attention score for each motion style w.r.t deconvolution filter weights in the target synthesis layer and softly attends different motion styles for weight modulation. Experimental results show our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on four unconditional 2562 video synthesis benchmarks trained with only 3 frames per clip and produces better qualitative results with respect to dynamic motions.",,"Under Review",https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690987/1/2304.02777.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690987/2304.02777.pdf.txt,2023-04-10T15:40:13

One proposed strategy for defining such processes on a metric graph Γ is through a covariance function that is isotropic in a metric on the graph. Another is through a fractional order differential equation Lα(τu)=W on Γ, where L=κ2−∇(a∇) for (sufficiently nice) functions κ,a, and W is Gaussian white noise. We study Markov properties of these two types of fields. We first show that there are no Gaussian random fields on general metric graphs that are both isotropic and Markov. We then show that the second type of fields, the generalized Whittle--Matérn fields, are Markov if and only if α∈N, and if α∈N, the field is Markov of order α, which essentially means that the process in one region S⊂Γ is conditionally independent the process in Γ∖S given the values of the process and its α−1 derivatives on ∂S. Finally, we show that the Markov property implies an explicit characterization of the process on a fixed edge e, which in particular shows that the conditional distribution of the process on e given the values at the two vertices connected to e is independent of the geometry of Γ.",,"Under Review",https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690986/1/2304.03190.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690986/2304.03190.pdf.txt,2023-04-10T15:40:12

Rev. B \textbf{105}, L180415 (2022)}]. In this effect, the number of the excited high harmonics is found to scale up with the spin-orbit coupling parameter, the s-d exchange constant of the magnetic system and the frequency of the driving dynamics. Motivated by the reproduction of the above-mentioned effect, Nikolić and Manjarres [arXiv:2212.06895, arXiv:2112.14685] confirmed that there is indeed a generation of harmonics as a result of the interplay between magnetic dynamics and spin-orbit interaction if the exchange coupling J is taken very small (J=0.1γ). However, they claim that the ultrahigh harmonics obtained in the strong J limit can only be a result of numerical bugs. It turns out that in these works, conclusions built from numerical simulations performed in the perturbative limit (J/ℏω≈10) have been applied to criticize results obtained in the extremely high non-linear regime (J/ℏω>103). Regarding this fact, we find it necessary to shed light on many aspects related to the physics behind the predicted unconventional carrier pumping, in order to enlighten the readers of the proposed effect and at the same time the authors of the criticizing works. Here, we present numerical simulations of the scaling laws underlying the effect. We study the low s-d exchange coupling limit, corresponding to the regime studied in the above mentioned criticizing works.

SLs are structurally diverse, divided into a canonical and a non-canonical sub-family. To better understand the biological function of particular SLs, we generated CRISPR/Cas9 mutants disrupted in OsMAX1-1400 or OsMAX1-1900, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP711A clade) contributing to SL diversity. The disruption of OsMAX1-1900 did neither affect the SL pattern nor plant architecture, indicating a functional redundancy. In contrast, disruption of OsMAX1-1400 activity, a 4-deoxyorobanchol hydroxylase, led to a complete lack of orobanchol and an accumulation of its precursor 4-deoxyorobanchol (4DO), both of which are a canonical SLs common in different plant species, accompanied by higher levels of the non-canonical methyl 4-oxo-carlactonoate (4-oxo-MeCLA). Os1400 mutants showed also shorter plant height, panicle and panicle base length, but did not exhibit a tillering phenotype. Hormone quantification and transcriptome analysis revealed elevated auxin levels and changes in the expression of auxin-related, as well as of SL biosynthetic genes. Interestingly, the Os900/1400 double mutant lacking both orobanchol and 4DO did not show the observed Os1400 architectural phenotypes, indicating that they are a result of 4DO accumulation. A comparison of the mycorrhization and Striga seed germinating activity of Os900, Os900/1400, and Os1400 loss-of-function mutants demonstrates that the germination activity positively correlates with 4DO content while disrupting OsMAX1-1400 negatively impact mycorrhizal symbiosis.

Uncovering Sensor Faults in Wind Turbines: An Improved Multivariate Statistical Approach for Condition Monitoring Using Scada Data. https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4409036","Fault detection in wind turbines is a critical aspect of maintaining the safety and reliability of wind energy systems. Wind turbines are complex systems that are subject to a wide range of potential faults, including mechanical failures, electrical malfunctions, and software errors. These faults can lead to a decrease in power production and a reduction in the lifetime of the turbine, as well as an increase in the risk of accidents and equipment damage. This paper presents a semi-supervised data-driven approach to detect sensor faults in wind turbines based on supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data. The proposed approach combines independent component analysis (ICA) benefits with the Kantorovich Distance (KD)-base fault detection scheme. Specifically, ICA can efficiently handle multivariate nonGaussian data, and the KD scheme is an effective fault detection indicator to assess the ICA residuals. The ICA-based KD scheme needs only fault-free data in training, making it more attractive for fault detection in practice. Kernel density estimation is employed to compute the detection threshold of the KD scheme, making it more flexible. To assess the detection capacity of this approach, several sensor faults are simulated based on real data from a wind turbine in France. Results demonstrated a high detection performance of the ICA-KD scheme with an averaged F1-score of around 0.96% and outperformed the conventional approaches.",,"Under Review",https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690980/1/SSRN-id4409036.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690980/SSRN-id4409036.pdf.txt,2023-04-10T15:00:08

In Costa Rica, the prevalence of these conditions has reached alarming values. Spatial analyses can identify risk factors and geographical patterns to develop tailored and effective public health actions in this context. Methods: A Bayesian spatial mixed model was built to understand the geographic patterns of childhood overweight and obesity prevalence in Costa Rica and their association with some socioeconomic factors. Data was obtained from the 2016 Weight and Size Census (6 - 12 years old children) and 2011 National Census. Results: Average years of schooling increase the levels of overweight and obesity until reaching an approximate value of 8 years, then they start to decrease. Moreover, for every 10-point increment in the percentage of homes with difficulties to cover their basic needs and in the percentage of population under 14 years old, there is a decrease of 7.7 and 14.0 points, respectively, in the odds of obesity. Spatial patterns show higher values of prevalence in the center area of the country, touristic destinations, head of province districts and in the borders with Panama. Conclusions: Especially for childhood obesity, the average years of schooling is a non-linear factor, describing a U-inverted curve.

Circulation. https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.122.063481","BACKGROUND: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is characterized by a phenotypic switch of valvular interstitial cells to bone-forming cells. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are evolutionarily conserved pattern recognition receptors at the interface between innate immunity and tissue repair. Type I interferons (IFNs) are not only crucial for an adequate antiviral response but also implicated in bone formation. We hypothesized that the accumulation of endogenous TLR3 ligands in the valvular leaflets may promote the generation of osteoblast-like cells through enhanced type I IFN signaling. METHODS: Human valvular interstitial cells isolated from aortic valves were challenged with mechanical strain or synthetic TLR3 agonists and analyzed for bone formation, gene expression profiles, and IFN signaling pathways. Different inhibitors were used to delineate the engaged signaling pathways. Moreover, we screened a variety of potential lipids and proteoglycans known to accumulate in CAVD lesions as potential TLR3 ligands. Ligand-receptor interactions were characterized by in silico modeling and verified through immunoprecipitation experiments. Biglycan (Bgn), Tlr3, and IFN-α/β receptor alpha chain (Ifnar1)–deficient mice and a specific zebrafish model were used to study the implication of the byglycan (BGN)-TLR3-IFN axis in both CAVD and bone formation in vivo. Two large-scale cohorts (GERA [Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging], n=55 192 with 3469 aortic stenosis cases; UK Biobank, n=257 231 with 2213 aortic stenosis cases) were examined for genetic variation at genes implicated in BGN-TLR3-IFN signaling associating with CAVD in humans. RESULTS: Here, we identify TLR3 as a central molecular regulator of calcification in valvular interstitial cells and unravel BGN as a new endogenous agonist of TLR3. Posttranslational BGN maturation by xylosyltransferase 1 (XYLT1) is required for TLR3 activation. Moreover, BGN induces the transdifferentiation of valvular interstitial cells into bone-forming osteoblasts through the TLR3-dependent induction of type I IFNs. It is intriguing that Bgn−/−, Tlr3−/−, and Ifnar1−/− mice are protected against CAVD and display impaired bone formation. Meta-analysis of 2 large-scale cohorts with >300 000 individuals reveals that genetic variation at loci relevant to the XYLT1–BGN–TLR3–interferon-α/β receptor alpha chain (IFNAR) 1 pathway is associated with CAVD in humans. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies the BGN-TLR3-IFNAR1 axis as an evolutionarily conserved pathway governing calcification of the aortic valve and reveals a potential therapeutic target to prevent CAVD.",,Published,,,2023-04-10T11:50:06

Nanoscale. https://doi.org/10.1039/d3nr00343d","Heat dissipation threatens the performance and lifetime of many electronic devices. As the size of devices shrinks to the nanoscale, we require spatially and thermally resolved thermometry to observe their fine thermal features. Scanning thermal microscopy (SThM) has proven to be a versatile measurement tool for characterizing the temperature at the surface of devices with nanoscale resolution. SThM can obtain qualitative thermal maps of a device using an operating principle based on a heat exchange process between a thermo-sensitive probe and the sample surface. However, the quantification of these thermal features is one of the most challenging parts of this technique. Developing reliable calibration approaches for SThM is therefore an essential aspect to accurately determine the temperature at the surface of a sample or device. In this work, we calibrate a thermo-resistive SThM probe using heater-thermometer metal lines with different widths (50 nm to 750 nm), which mimic variable probe-sample thermal exchange processes. The sensitivity of the SThM probe when scanning the metal lines is also evaluated under different probe and line temperatures. Our results reveal that the calibration factor depends on the probe measuring conditions and on the size of the surface heating features. This approach is validated by mapping the temperature profile of a phase change electronic device. Our analysis provides new insights on how to convert the thermo-resistive SThM probe signal to the scanned device temperature more accurately.",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690969/1/d3nr00343d.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690969/d3nr00343d.pdf.txt,2023-04-10T11:00:09

However, the field of cnidarian epigenetics is hampered by a lack of applicable protocols, partly due to the unique features of model organisms such as the symbiotic sea anemone Exaiptasia diaphana, whose high water content and mucus amounts obstruct molecular methods.

Strategies must be adopted for sustainable wheat crop production to fill the ever-increasing food demand. Salinity is one of the major abiotic stresses involved in plant growth retardation and grain yield reduction. In plants, calcineurin-B-like proteins form a complicated network with the target kinase CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) in response to intracellular calcium signaling as a consequence of abiotic stresses. The AtCIPK16 gene has been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana and found to be significantly upregulated under salinity stress. In this study, the AtCIPK16 gene was cloned in two different plant expression vectors, i.e., pTOOL37 having a UBI1 promoter and pMDC32 having a 2XCaMV35S constitutive promoter transformed through the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation protocol, in the local wheat cultivar Faisalabad-2008. Based on their ability to tolerate different levels of salt stress (0, 50, 100, and 200 mM), the transgenic wheat lines OE1, OE2, and OE3 expressing AtCIPK16 under the UBI1 promoter and OE5, OE6, and OE7 expressing the same gene under the 2XCaMV35S promoter performed better at 100 mM of salinity stress as compared with the wild type. The AtCIPK16 overexpressing transgenic wheat lines were further investigated for their K+ retention ability in root tissues by utilizing the microelectrode ion flux estimation technique. It has been demonstrated that after 10 min of 100 mM NaCl application, more K+ ions were retained in the AtCIPK16 overexpressing transgenic wheat lines than in the wild type. Moreover, it could be concluded that AtCIPK16 functions as a positive elicitor in sequestering Na+ ions into the cell vacuole and retaining more cellular K+ under salt stress to maintain ionic homeostasis.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690967/1/fpls-14-1127311.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690967/fpls-14-1127311.pdf.txt,2023-04-10T10:40:18

More specifically, introducing a strong electron-deficient or electron-rich third moiety is suggested to enable broadened absorption with minimized non-radiative voltage losses. Besides, the third component should manipulate the D/A miscibility towards a thermodynamically more stable morphology. However, the content of the third component should be small to maintain molecular orientation and exciton diffusion length in conjunction with optimized phase-separation and crystallinity, in turn reducing bimolecular carrier recombination.

Conventionally, ABS polymer is pretreated in concentrated sulfochromic acid solution before plating to develop a highly porous surface topography that ensures coating adhesion. Unfortunately, using chromic acid produces extremely hazardous chemical waste, which costs manufacturers millions of dollars in fines. This study proposes a threefold greener route by employing a newly developed in-mold patterning of polymeric parts before plating. We hot-embossed micron-sized dimples on the ABS polymer and acid-etched it for as short as 1 min to obtain a hierarchical micro–nanotextured surface. The coating adhesion on such surfaces appeared to be two times higher as compared to the conventional electroplating, while the etching time was reduced three times. Microscopic characterization of the fracture surfaces revealed that the adhesion strength at the hierarchically structured interface exceeded the strength of the ABS polymer, causing a cohesive crack in the polymer far below the interface when peeling the plated metallic film. These results imply that the use of toxic acids in the electroplating industry can be drastically reduced by the proposed hybrid preparation method without sacrificing the coating quality.",,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690962/1/1-s2.0-S2238785423006956-main_removed.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690962/1-s2.0-S2238785423006956-main_removed.pdf.txt,2023-04-10T10:10:09

The sheet is traveling with a temperature and velocity that are inversely related to how far away from the steady edge it is from the plane in which it is traveling. We also imposed external velocity u=uex=Dxp in the boundary. The necessary major equations are made dimensionless by the local non-similarity transformation and become a system of non-linear ordinary differential equations after being transformed from non-linear partial differential equations. The subsequent numerical solution of the arisen non-dimensional boundary value problem utilizes a sixth-order Runge–Kutta integration scheme and Nachtsheim–Swigert shooting iterative technique. A good correlation is seen when the solutions are compared to previously published results from the literature. Through the use of graphical representation, the physical impacts of the fluid parameters on speed, induced magnetic field, and temperature distribution are carried out. Furthermore, the distributions for skin friction coefficient and local Nusselt number are also studied for different scenarios. The skin friction coefficient and local Nusselt number are observed to increase with greater values of the temperature exponent parameter and velocity exponent parameter. However, as heat radiation increases, the local Nusselt number decreases even though temperatures are noticeably higher.

As a semiconductor, Ga2O3 has a much higher bandgap, breakdown electric field, and dielectric constant than silicon, making it a great choice for next-generation semiconductor materials. In addition, Ga2O3 is a particularly robust material that can withstand a wide range of temperatures and pressure levels, thus is ideal for harsh environments such as space or extreme temperatures. Finally, its superior electron transport properties enable higher levels of electrical switching speed than traditional semiconducting materials. Endowing Ga2O3-based devices with good mechanical robustness and flexibility is crucial to make them suitable for use in applications such as wearable electronics, implantable electronics, and automotive electronics. However, as a typical ceramic material, Ga2O3 is intrinsically brittle and requires high temperatures for its crystallization. Therefore fabricating flexible Ga2O3 devices is not a straightforward task by directly utilizing the commonly used polymer substrates. In this context, in recent years people have developed several fabrication routes, which are the transfer route, in situ room-temperature amorphous route, and in situ high-temperature epitaxy route. In this review, we discuss the advantages and limitations of each technique and evaluate the opportunities for and challenges in realizing the applications of flexible Ga2O3 devices.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Published,,,2023-04-09T16:20:10

Due to the sporadic nature of IoT transmissions, the energy consumption of the individual IoT transmission session varies dramatically with the instantaneous operating environment as well as the quality of service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, we analyze and design the energyefficient relay transmission systems from an individual data transmission session perspective. Specifically, we consider a dualhop transmission system with a decode-and-forward relay that is solely powered by wireless power transfer from source node. For both time switching and power splitting modes of simultaneous power and information transmission, we analyze and minimize the total energy consumption of the system when transmitting a fixed amount of data, under a piecewise linear energy harvesting (EH) model. Closed-form expressions for optimal transmission parameters are obtained with and without the consideration of latency constraint. Through selected numerical results, we illustrate various design tradeoffs between energy consumption and latency constraint. We show that with optimal transmission parameters, relay transmission with energy transfer can achieve considerable energy saving compared to direct transmission when the direct link quality is poor and the latency constraint is not stringent. We also show that with optimized parameters, power splitting mode leads to lower energy consumption and smaller transmission duration than time switching mode, at the cost of higher implementation complexity.",,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690932/1/Ultra-Green_Relay_Transmission_with_Wireless_Power_Transfer_for_Advanced_IoT_Session-Specific_Analysis_and_Optimization.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690932/Ultra-Green_Relay_Transmission_with_Wireless_Power_Transfer_for_Advanced_IoT_Session-Specific_Analysis_and_Optimization.pdf.txt,2023-04-09T15:40:11

Existing studies in Europe have focused mainly on acarological risk assessment, with few investigations exploring human LB occurrence. Aim: We explored the determinants of spatial and seasonal LB variations in France from 2016 to 2021 by integrating environmental, animal, meteorological and anthropogenic factors, and then mapped seasonal LB risk predictions. Methods: We fitted 2016-19 LB national surveillance data to a two-part spatio-temporal statistical model. Spatial and temporal random effects were specified using a Besag-York-Mollie model and a seasonal model, respectively. Coefficients were estimated in a Bayesian framework using integrated nested Laplace approximation. Data from 2020-21 were used for model validation. Results: A high vegetation index (≥ 0.6) was positively associated with seasonal LB presence, while the index of deer presence (> 60%), mild soil temperature (15-22 °C), moderate air saturation deficit (1.5-5 mmHg) and higher tick bite frequency were associated with increased incidence. Prediction maps show a higher risk of LB in spring and summer (April-September), with higher incidence in parts of eastern, midwestern and south-western France. Conclusion: We present a national level spatial assessment of seasonal LB occurrence in Europe, disentangling factors associated with the presence and increased incidence of LB. Our findings yield quantitative evidence for national public health agencies to plan targeted prevention campaigns to reduce LB burden, enhance surveillance and identify further data needs.

This process allows the capture of carbon dioxide by condensing the steam from the exhaust gases which avoids the need for the energy intensive step of separation of carbon dioxide from combustion products that is otherwise needed in conventional plants. These results are compared with a standard calcination cycle using fossil fuels with carbon dioxide capture based on oxyfuel combustion. A process model is used to estimate the capture efficiencies as being 98.6% for the carbon dioxide and 90.7% for the water, which can be recycled. This novel approach adds negligible energy cost except for the carbon dioxide compression unit which is an essential unit for all capture technologies. A techno-economic analysis of both processes, namely, steam calcination and natural gas with oxyfuel combustion, estimates that cost parity is achieved when the price of hydrogen reaches the range between US$1/kg – US$2/kg, relative to the current and projected price for natural gas. With hydrogen production costs projected to reach these values in the future, this approach appears to offer good potential once demonstrated at a reasonable scale. Furthermore, the cost of carbon dioxide transport and storage is estimated to be reduced by 23.9% for the steam calcination process, by avoiding the need to sequester any combustion products.",,Published,,,2023-04-09T14:00:08

The well-known backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm proposed to train SNNs suffers from large memory footprint and prohibits backward and update unlocking, making it impossible to exploit the potential of locally-supervised training methods. This work proposes an efficient and direct training algorithm for SNNs that integrates a locally-supervised training method with a temporally-truncated BPTT algorithm. The proposed algorithm explores both temporal and spatial locality in BPTT and contributes to significant reduction in computational cost including GPU memory utilization, main memory access and arithmetic operations. We thoroughly explore the design space concerning temporal truncation length and local training block size and benchmark their impact on classification accuracy of different networks running different types of tasks. The results reveal that temporal truncation has a negative effect on the accuracy of classifying frame-based datasets, but leads to improvement in accuracy on event-based datasets. In spite of resulting information loss, local training is capable of alleviating overfitting. The combined effect of temporal truncation and local training can lead to the slowdown of accuracy drop and even improvement in accuracy. In addition, training deep SNNs' models such as AlexNet classifying CIFAR10-DVS dataset leads to 7.26% increase in accuracy, 89.94% reduction in GPU memory, 10.79% reduction in memory access, and 99.64% reduction in MAC operations compared to the standard end-to-end BPTT.

As psychrotolerant/psychrophilic bacteria can be considered promising sources for novel products such as bioactive compounds and other industrially relevant substances/compounds, the IPAC21 genome was sequenced using Illumina Hi-seq, and a search for genes related to the production of bioemulsifiers and other metabolic pathways was performed. The IPAC21 strain has a genome of 5,505,124 bp and a G + C content of 40.5%. Genes related to the biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides, such as the gene that encodes the extracellular enzyme levansucrase responsible for the synthesis of levan, the 2,3-butanediol pathway, PTS sugar transporters, cold-shock proteins, and chaperones were found in its genome. IPAC21 cell-free supernatants obtained after cell growth in trypticase soy broth at different temperatures were evaluated for bioemulsifier production by the emulsification index (EI) using hexadecane, kerosene and diesel. EI values higher than 50% were obtained using the three oil derivatives when IPAC21 was grown at 28°C. The bioemulsifier produced by P. antarcticus IPAC21 was stable at different NaCl concentrations, low temperatures and pH values, suggesting its potential use in lower and moderate temperature processes in the petroleum industry.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690914/1/fmicb-14-1142582.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690914/fmicb-14-1142582.pdf.txt,2023-04-09T10:50:06

Portico. https://doi.org/10.1002/aenm.202300331","Dendritic deposition and side reactions have been long-standing interfacial challenges of Zn anode, which have prevented the development of practical aqueous zinc-based batteries. Herein, an oxygen vacancy-rich CeO2 aerogel (VAG-Ce) interface layer that simultaneously integrates Zn2+ selectivity, porosity, and is lightweight is reported as a new strategy to achieve dendrite-free and corrosion-free Zn anodes. The well-defined and uniform nanochannels of VAG-Ce can act as ion sieves that redistribute Zn2+ at the Zn anode surface by regulating Zn2+ flux, leading to uniform Zn deposition and significantly suppressing dendrite growth. Importantly, the abundant oxygen vacancies exposed on VAG-Ce surface can strongly capture SO42−, forming a negatively charged layer that can attract Zn2+ and accelerate the Zn2+ migration kinetics, while the subsequent repulsion of additional anions can effectively suppress the generation of (Zn4SO4(OH)6·xH2O) byproducts, thereby realizing very stable Zn anodes. Consequently, VAG-Ce modified Zn anode (VAG-Ce@Zn) enables a long-term lifespan over 4000 h at 4 mA cm−2 and a record-high cycle life of 1200 h is achieved under an ultrahigh 85% Zn utilization at 8 mA cm−2, which enables excellent capacity retention and cycling performance of VAG@Zn/MnO2 cells.

A Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LH)-based surface mechanism was coupled with gas-phase reactions (KAM 1-GS mechanism).

The improved LH mechanism, dividing the adsorption steps and surface reactions, provides flexible temperature and pressure dependencies to reproduce the experimental results across broad pressure conditions (0.010–0.80 MPa CH4). Specifically, the adsorption constant of C2H4 was found 20 times larger than that of C2H6 due to the π-electron-related high affinity of C2H4 to the surface. Additionally, high-pressure conditions were well described by considering the non-isothermal behavior from OCM reactions and heat dissipation from the reactor.

The first approach introduced is a standard Galerkin method on Powell-Sabin meshes, which has recently been shown to yield convergent approximations in two dimensions, whereas the other two are stabilized formulations that can be motivated by a variational multiscale approach. For the latter, a mixed formulation equivalent to the original problem is used, in which the operator has a saddle point structure. The Lagrange multiplier introduced to enforce the divergence constraint vanishes in an appropriate functional setting. The first stabilized method we consider consists of an augmented formulation with the introduction of a mesh dependent term that can be regarded as the Laplacian of the multiplier of the divergence constraint. The second formulation is based on orthogonal projections, which can be recast as a residual based stabilization technique. We rely on the classical spectral theory to analyze the approximating methods for the eigenproblem. The stability and convergence aspects are inherited from the associated source problems. We investigate the numerical performance of the proposed formulations and provide some convergence results validating the theoretical ones for several benchmark tests, including ones with smooth and singular solutions.",,"Under Review",https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690883/1/2304.00095.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690883/2304.00095.pdf.txt,2023-04-05T16:30:08

A large microbiome fraction (58% of the total amplicon sequence variants) is endemic to single mountain ranges, while 0.4% are disproportionately abundant and form a cosmopolitan core. These microbiome components have overlapping taxonomies, but their compositional turnover is differently shaped by dispersal limitation and environmental selection.

Among the properties, binding affinity to a target is one of the prerequisites and usually evaluated by molecular docking or quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models. Methods: In this study, we developed Simplified molecular input line entry system Generative Pretrained Transformer with Reinforcement Learning (SGPT-RL), which uses a transformer decoder as the policy network of the reinforcement learning agent to optimize the binding affinity to a target. SGPT-RL was evaluated on the Moses distribution learning benchmark and two goal-directed generation tasks, with Dopamine Receptor D2 (DRD2) and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the targets. Both QSAR model and molecular docking were implemented as the optimization goals in the tasks. The popular Reinvent method was used as the baseline for comparison. Results: The results on Moses benchmark showed that SGPT-RL learned good property distributions and generated molecules with high validity and novelty. On the two goal-directed generation tasks, both SGPT-RL and Reinvent were able to generate valid molecules with improved target scores. The SGPT-RL method achieved better results than Reinvent on the ACE2 task, where molecular docking was used as the optimization goal. Further analysis shows that SGPT-RL learned conserved scaffold patterns during exploration. Conclusions: The superior performance of SGPT-RL in the ACE2 task indicates that it can be applied to the virtual screening process where molecular docking is widely used as the criteria.

The influence of the biofilm thickness on the mechanisms of removal was analyzed via kinetic test at three different stages. At all biofilm stages, biodegradation was demonstrated to dominate the removal of selected OMPs. Higher OMPs rates of removal via biodegradation (Kbiol) were achieved when biofilm increased its thickness from (stage T1) 0.26mm, (stage T2) 0.58 mm and (stage T3) 1.03 mm. At stage T1 of biofilm, heterotrophs contribute predominantly to OMPs degradation. Hydrophilic compounds removal (i.e., acetaminophen) continue to be driven by heterotrophic bacteria at the next stages of biofilm thickness. However, for medium hydrophobic neutral and charged OMPs, the combined action of heterotrophic and enriched nitrifying activity at stages T2 and T3 enhanced the overall removal. A degradation pathway based on heterotrophic activity for acetaminophen and combined action of nitrifiers-heterotrophs for estrone was proposed based on identified metabolites. Although biodegradation dominated the removal of most OMPs, sorption was also observed to be essential in the removal of biologically recalcitrant and lipophilic compounds like triclosan. Furthermore, sorption capacity of apolar compound was enhanced as the biofilm thickness grew and increased in EPS protein fraction. Microbial analysis confirmed the higher abundance of nitrifying and denitrifying activity at stage T3 of biofilm, which not only facilitated near complete ammonium removal but also enhanced degradation of OMPs.",,Published,,,2023-04-05T15:40:12

However, it is challenging to achieve both high selectivity and high activity of the catalysts for the electro-oxidation of alcohols, such as the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Herein, a monolithic CuS@CuO/copper-foam electrode for the MOR with superior catalytic activity and almost 100% selectivity for formate is reported. In the core-shell CuS@CuO nanosheet arrays, the surface CuO directly catalyzes MOR, while the subsurface sulfide not only serves as an inhibitor to attenuate the oxidative power of the surface CuO to achieve selective oxidation of methanol to formate and prevent over-oxidation of formate to CO2 but also serves as an activator to form more surface O defects as active sites and enhances the methanol adsorption and charge transfer to achieve superior catalytic activity.

Mainstream underwater grippers are designed for the heavy load tasks typical of the industrial sector; however, due to the lack of alternatives, they are frequently used in biological sampling applications to handle irregular, delicate, and deformable specimens with a consequent high risk of damage. To overcome this limitation, the design of grippers for marine science applications should explicitly account for the requirements of end-users. In this paper, we aim at making a step forward and propose to systematically account for the needs of end-users by resorting to design tools used in industry for the conceptualization of new products which can yield great benefits to both applied robotic research and marine science.

The influence of the biofilm thickness on the mechanisms of removal was analyzed via kinetic test at three different stages. At all biofilm stages, biodegradation was demonstrated to dominate the removal of selected OMPs. Higher OMPs rates of removal via biodegradation (Kbiol) were achieved when biofilm increased its thickness from (stage T1) 0.26mm, (stage T2) 0.58 mm and (stage T3) 1.03 mm. At stage T1 of biofilm, heterotrophs contribute predominantly to OMPs degradation. Hydrophilic compounds removal (i.e., acetaminophen) continue to be driven by heterotrophic bacteria at the next stages of biofilm thickness. However, for medium hydrophobic neutral and charged OMPs, the combined action of heterotrophic and enriched nitrifying activity at stages T2 and T3 enhanced the overall removal. A degradation pathway based on heterotrophic activity for acetaminophen and combined action of nitrifiers-heterotrophs for estrone was proposed based on identified metabolites. Although biodegradation dominated the removal of most OMPs, sorption was also observed to be essential in the removal of biologically recalcitrant and lipophilic compounds like triclosan. Furthermore, sorption capacity of apolar compound was enhanced as the biofilm thickness grew and increased in EPS protein fraction. Microbial analysis confirmed the higher abundance of nitrifying and denitrifying activity at stage T3 of biofilm, which not only facilitated near complete ammonium removal but also enhanced degradation of OMPs.",,Published,,,2023-04-05T10:10:07

So the main objective of this research is to determine the influences of the parameters in the accidents of stuck pipes using the construction of XGBoost models. To develop the model, drilling parameters are taken from daily drilling reports of the construction of 30 wells in the West Qurna field, Iraq. The data includes well drilling reports from 2013 to 2020. The results show that the factors such as Measured depth (MD), Rate of penetration (ROP), 10-sec gel (GEL1), Plastic Viscosity (PV), Mud weight (MW), Yield point (YP) contribute positively to the model predictions. In contrast, the factors such as Flow rate (FR), Rotation per minute (RPM), Filtrate (API/HPHT-FILTR and Bottom hole assembly (BHA) length has a negative contribution to the final model predictions. This research concluded that pipe sticking in the borehole is primarily due to inclination, penetration rate, and flow rate.

However, such trained CNN models often largely degrade on testing data which is unseen and Out-Of-the-Distribution (OOD). To address this issue, we propose a novel “Decoupled-Mixup"" method to train CNN models for OOD visual recognition. Different from previous work combining pairs of images homogeneously, our method decouples each image into discriminative and noise-prone regions, and then heterogeneously combine these regions of image pairs to train CNN models. Since the observation is that noise-prone regions such as textural and clutter background are adverse to the generalization ability of CNN models during training, we enhance features from discriminative regions and suppress noise-prone ones when combining an image pair. To further improves the generalization ability of trained models, we propose to disentangle discriminative and noise-prone regions in frequency-based and context-based fashions. Experiment results show the high generalization performance of our method on testing data that are composed of unseen contexts, where our method achieves 85.76% top-1 accuracy in Track-1 and 79.92% in Track-2 in NICO Challenge.",,Published,,,2023-04-03T17:00:07

Lattice structures were fabricated and programmed to get tuneable mechanical properties.

This study suggests transporting hydrogen as a gas at atmospheric pressure in balloons using the natural flow of wind to carry the balloon to its destination. We investigate the average wind speeds, atmospheric pressure, and temperature at different altitudes for this purpose. The ideal altitudes to transport hydrogen with balloons are 10 km or lower, and hydrogen pressures in the balloon vary from 0.25 to 1 bar. Transporting hydrogen from North America to Europe at a maximum 4 km altitude would take around 4.8 days on average. Hydrogen balloon transportation cost is estimated at 0.025 USD/kg of hydrogen, which is around 40 times smaller than the cost of transporting liquified hydrogen from the USA to Europe.

To maintain a secure and effective supply, the design and operation of these systems must carefully account for the influence of weather variability on the availability of renewable energy resources and on energy demand. This study examines the impact of weather variability on the optimal design and operation of renewable energy systems for office buildings in Saudi Arabia. The building electricity demand is supplied by a photovoltaic/wind/battery storage system, with an additional connection to the grid. The optimization process then aims at finding the optimal capacities of the renewable energy system components, so as to strike a trade-off between life cycle cost and CO2 emissions by considering weather datasets with different levels of variability. The results show that accounting for the full weather variability, particularly the extreme weather events, leads to higher investment costs in fully renewable energy system, namely due to increased battery storage (up to 288%). Neglecting extreme events at the design stage, however, leads to a significant performance gap that could be compensated by grid integration, which adds to the overall CO2 emissions, for a negligible change in the system cost. Such extreme weather events are then associated with cloudy and high temperatures days, the impact of which drives down the photovoltaic power output and increases the demand for energy from the grid or from the storage. The study further examines the electricity price impacts on renewable energy system design and operation. With global weather variability challenges at the forefront, the paper findings draw insightful recommendations related to energy policy.",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,Published,,,2023-04-03T11:00:08

Thus, design rules that guide material development are needed. One such design principle is that in a bulk heterojunction consisting of an electron donor and lower bandgap acceptor an offset (ΔIE) of at least 0.45 eV is required between both materials ionization energies to overcome energy level bending at the donor–acceptor interface, in turn maximizing the charge separation yield and the cell's internal quantum efficiency. The present work studies energy losses associated with ΔIE and, based on 24 blends, finds that losses are minimal up to a ΔIE of 0.6 eV. Electroluminescence spectroscopy shows that low energy losses are achieved when the charge transfer state energy (ECT) is similar to the acceptor's optical bandgap (EgA). Further ΔIE increase lowers ECT with respect to EgA, thus decreasing VOC. Within that 0.45–0.6 eV ΔIE sweet range, the fill factor FF, hence the power conversion efficiency, increases only marginally as the FF is often already close to maximal for ΔIE = 0.45 eV.

The interaction of the particles attracted by the bubble surface is simulated by the Lennard–Jones potential that simplifies the capture due to the hydrophobic properties of the ions. In our model, the effect of the potential is replaced by a suitable boundary condition derived by mass conservation and asymptotic analysis. The potential is assumed to have a range of small size ε. An asymptotic expansion in the ε is considered, and the boundary conditions are obtained by retaining the lowest-order terms in the expansion. Another aspect we investigate is the saturation effect coming from high concentrations in the proximity of the bubble surface.

By defining a min-max optimization problem, where the control input minimizes the frequency deviations while the external disturbances maximizes the cost function, a robust control law is designed. The outcome leads to setting the frequency to its desired value and at the same time effects of disturbances are attenuated by applying the H∞ optimal controller in the secondary control level of AC microgrids. Since the basic ZSDG controller cannot eliminate adverse effects of external disturbances on the system frequency, an extended-ZSDG (EZSDG) method is introduced to design an effective H∞ controller. Due to the lack of access to the state variables of the microgrids, a full-order observer is designed to estimate these variables based on the measured output.

An improved understanding of microcrystals' morphology that hosts micropores, their impact on reservoir properties, and their spatial distributions will contribute to a more accurate reservoir quality prediction. This study proposes a methodology that utilizes machine learning approaches for microporosity characterization and integrates a multi-scale dataset ranging from micrometer-scale SEM images to meter-scale seismic attributes to build reservoir porosity models. We tested the methodology on an outcrop in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which exposes the upper part of the Jubaila Formation equivalent to the lower part of the Arab-D reservoir. We acquired a 35 m-long core and a 600 m-long 2D seismic line behind the outcrop. Laboratory-scale petrophysical measurements, including porosity, permeability, acoustic velocity, bulk and grain density, and x-ray diffraction, were performed over 106 horizontal core plugs drilled from the core. We quantitatively characterized the morphology and microtextures of micrite crystals using SEM images by performing Random Forest classifications trained on SEM image features. We performed unsupervised classification using Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to all lab-measured properties for data clustering. We investigated potential correlations between SOM clusters with micrite morphology, which resulted in a predictable relationship following the granularity and sphericity of microcrystals with porosity, permeability, and acoustic velocity. It was possible to represent multiple lithofacies with a single log-linear porosity-permeability relationship and a single value of equivalent differential effective medium (DEM) aspect ratio in velocity-porosity space. The inter-relationship between micrite morphology and microporosity in the well was then propagated to reservoir-grid scale using inverse differential effective medium (DEM) of acoustic impedance from inverted seismic data.

However, very little literature focuses on ULWC, especially where the communication distance ups to thousands of kilometers, which is urgently required in the underwater Internet of Things (UIoT) in the large-scale and deep sea. In this paper, to improve the underwater communication capacity at a level of thousands of kilometers, we propose a three-hop underwater wireless acoustic communication (3H-UWAC) structure based on the Sound Fixing and Ranging (SOFAR) channel. The proposed 3H-UWAC consists of transmitters, relay stations (RSs), and receivers. Different from the existing ULWC, 3H-ULWC can improve energy efficiency with a small vertical directivity angle (VDA). Due to the characteristics of UWAC, the straight-line communication link can be realized in the proposed three hops, and the communication distance can be increased to thousands of kilometers. Respecting the randomness of underwater devices, tools from stochastic geometry are used to model the spatial distributions of transmitters’, receivers’, and RSs’ locations. RSs are set on the SOFAR channel at a known depth. In the first hop, the transmitter sends information to the nearest first relay station (NFRS) on the SOFAR plane. In the second hop, the NFRS sends information to the nearest relay station, which is called the nearest second relay station (NSRS), to the receiver on the SOFAR plane. In the third hop, SNFS sends information to the receiver. All three communication hops can be achieved with a narrow beam width, where the energy efficiency is improved critically.

Journal of Materials Chemistry A. https://doi.org/10.1039/d3ta00411b","Stable lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) have promise to shape a new generation of stable energy-storage devices. Although the energy densities of LSBs (up to 2500 W h kg−1) are higher than those of conventional Li-ion batteries (LIBs), lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttling remains a pressing issue that leads to irreversible loss of active materials, degraded capacity, and eroded durability of LSBs. To tackle this issue, in this study we modified commercial polypropylene (PP) or pristine separators by laminating them with a layer of crumpled MoS2 (c-MoS2) nanosheets; the resulting assembly is referred to herein as MC-separator. We synthesized the c-MoS2 nanosheets using a special electrohydrodynamic process and laminated them onto the PP separator through simple vacuum filtration. The synthesized c-MoS2 nanosheets featured a metallic 1T-phase enriched with strained sulfur vacancies and a high surface area, providing additional redox reaction sites for LiPSs during battery operations. The c-MoS2 thin film could adsorb the LiPSs while providing additional reaction sites to reutilize these LiPSs, ultimately enhancing the specific capacity of the battery. When operated at a rate of 0.5C, a cell comprising a sulfur-expanded graphite cathode, the MC separator, and a Li anode provided a high specific capacity (1242 mA h g−1) with approximately 96% coulombic efficiency over 500 cycles. In contrast, a cell prepared with a PP separator, when operated at 0.5C, provided an initial capacity of only 746 mA h g−1 and could be run for only 296 cycles. The high capacity and good cycling stability of our new cell indicate that the MC separator could suppress the LiPSs shuttle effect, allowing better utilization of the active materials even at high C rates.",,Published,,,2023-04-02T16:50:08

We show that the superlattice hosts hybrid-improper ferroelectricity despite the fact that bulk Sr2FeOsO6 realizes an a0a0c− tilting pattern of the O octahedra. The magnitude is comparable to that of conventional ferroelectric materials and is found to increase under both compressive and tensile strain. In contrast to competing superlattices, a ferrimagnetic critical temperature above room temperature is realized. An indirect-to-direct band-gap transition is observed between n +1% and +2% strain, coming along with localization of the valence and conduction states on different transition-metal sublattices, which enables efficient electron-hole separation upon photoexcitation. The potential gradient due to the ferroelectric polarization supports the electron-hole separation and a spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency of 27% confirms excellent potential in solar cell applications. The tunable room-temperature ferroelectricity, high critical temperature of the ferrimagnetic ordering with high magnetization, and favorable photoabsorption properties of the Ca2FeOsO6/Sr2FeOsO6 superlattice open up a broad range of technological applications.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690798/1/PhysRevB.107.094419.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690798/PhysRevB.107.094419.pdf.txt,2023-04-02T16:10:07

Sediment deposits in such restricted environments are archives of prevailing environmental conditions during lagoon infill. For Indonesia, no paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on Holocene lagoon sediments exist. Here we analyze the sedimentary record obtained from five percussion cores penetrating 10 m into the unconsolidated subsurface of a reef island in the Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia. The combined compositional, textural and chronostratigraphic analyses reveal that the sedimentary infill of the lagoon underlying the island, starting 6900 years cal BP, was interrupted between 5800 and 4400 years cal BP, when sea level was ~ 0.5 m higher than at present, and monsoon intensity was lower. After the intensity of the monsoons increased to modern levels, and sea level dropped to its present position, lagoonal sedimentation was re-initiated and created the foundation for an island that built up since 3000 years cal BP. Our study provides the first geological evidence for the strong sensitivity of detrital carbonate systems in Indonesia to fluctuations in sea level and dominant wind direction.

Monolayer GDY (ML-GDY) is predicted to be an ideal two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor material with a wide range of applications. However, its preparation has not been achieved experimentally due to difficulties with synthesis. Here, we report that in-situ polymerization of hexaethynylbenzene within the sub-nanometer interlayer space of MXene can effectively prevent out-of-plane growth or vertical stacking of the material, resulting in crystalline ML-GDY. The subsequent exfoliation process successfully yields free-standing GDY monolayers with micrometer-scale lateral dimensions. The fabrication of field-effect transistor on free-standing ML-GDY makes the first measurement of its electronic properties possible. The measured electrical conductivity (5.1×103 S m-1) and carrier mobility (231.4 cm2 V−1 s−1) at room temperature are remarkably higher than those of the previously reported multilayer GDY materials.

The present study reveals that upper ocean (from surface to 50 m depth) stratification exhibits decadal and multidecadal variability in the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean (EEIO), southwestern tropical Indian Ocean (SWTIO), and head Bay of Bengal. The forced ocean model successfully simulated the decadal variability in stratification and is consistent with analysis and reanalysis products though with some underestimation of amplitude. The study further shows that upper ocean salinity has a stronger influence on the EEIO stratification variability whereas stratification over SWTIO is largely affected by the upper ocean temperature through Rossby wave propagation. The present study also highlights the growing role of equatorial currents in modulating the stratification over EEIO in the recent decades. The anomalous equatorial currents amplify the stratification variability along EEIO especially in the recent decades. Apart from the atmospheric and surface oceanic impact, subsurface ocean dynamics do impact stratification over EEIO and SWTIO regions by modulating subsurface temperature and salinity. Model sensitivity experiments reveal that decadal variability in both stratification and surface salinity over the head Bay of Bengal is modulated by river runoff. On the other hand, TIO stratification is largely unaffected by the Pacific Ocean pathways except for the southeastern Indian Ocean. Moreover, the climate modes, such as the decadal Indian Ocean Dipole and Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, modulate stratification over the TIO through modulation of precipitation and evaporation.",,Published,,,2023-04-02T15:10:08

These ratings do not provide the actual production potential of the system in a field with fluctuating conditions of irradiance and temperature. For the case of a concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) system, utilizing multi-junction solar cells (MJCs), there is no commercial tool available to analyze the performance and production, despite some recent empirical models that also require post-processing of experimental data to be used in conventional models. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN)-based performance model is presented for a multi-junction solar cell, which is not only convenient to apply but can also be easily expanded to predict the real-field performance of the CPV system of any designed size. In addition, the ANN-based model showed a high accuracy of 99.9% in predicting the performance output of MJCs as compared to diode-based empirical models available in the literature.

Computed results show backscatter of scalar (combustion progress variable c) variance, i.e. its transfer from SGS to resolved scales, even in a highly turbulent flame characterized by a unity-order Damköhler number and a ratio of Kolmogorov length scale to thermal laminar flame thickness as low as 0.05. Analysis of scalar fluxes associated with the solenoidal and potential velocity fields yielded by HHD shows that the documented backscatter stems primarily from the potential velocity perturbations generated due to dilatation in instantaneous local flames, with the backscatter being substantially promoted by a close alignment of the spatial gradient of mean scalar progress variable and the potential-velocity contribution to the local SGS scalar flux. The alignment is associated with the fact that combustion-induced thermal expansion increases local velocity in the direction of ∇c.

Briefings in Bioinformatics. https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbad118","Identifying disease–gene associations is a fundamental and critical biomedical task towards understanding molecular mechanisms, the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. It is time-consuming and expensive to experimentally verify causal links between diseases and genes. Recently, deep learning methods have achieved tremendous success in identifying candidate genes for genetic diseases. The gene prediction problem can be modeled as a link prediction problem based on the features of nodes and edges of the gene–disease graph. However, most existing researches either build homogeneous networks based on one single data source or heterogeneous networks based on multi-source data, and artificially define meta-paths, so as to learn the network representation of diseases and genes. The former cannot make use of abundant multi-source heterogeneous information, while the latter needs domain knowledge and experience when defining meta-paths, and the accuracy of the model largely depends on the definition of meta-paths. To address the aforementioned challenges above bottlenecks, we propose an end-to-end disease–gene association prediction model with parallel graph transformer network (DGP-PGTN), which deeply integrates the heterogeneous information of diseases, genes, ontologies and phenotypes. DGP-PGTN can automatically and comprehensively capture the multiple latent interactions between diseases and genes, discover the causal relationship between them and is fully interpretable at the same time. We conduct comprehensive experiments and show that DGP-PGTN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly on the task of disease–gene association prediction. Furthermore, DGP-PGTN can automatically learn the implicit relationship between diseases and genes without manually defining meta paths.",,Published,,,2023-04-02T14:30:08

Despite expected intra-chain rigidity of the polymer, previous experimental reports observed significant loss in CO2/CH4 perm-selectivity under high-pressure mixed-gas conditions. In this work, all-atomistic simulations were applied to accurately predict density, gas uptakes and gas diffusion properties of PIM-Trip-TB. Competitive sorption favoring CO2 over CH4 was apparent in mixed-gas sorption simulations, as previously demonstrated by experimental studies from our group. This effect resulted in enhanced mixed-gas CO2/CH4 solubility selectivity. However, this increase did not translate to increased mixed-gas perm-selectivity because a significant increase in CH4 permeability was observed by co-permeation of CO2 relative to the pure-gas value. Back-calculated diffusion coefficients indicated very low CO2/CH4 diffusion selectivity under mixed-gas conditions, eliminating any gain from competitive sorption. Structural analysis confirmed intact intra-chain rigidity of the polymer; on the other hand, a significant increase in fractional free volume (FFV) and shift to larger pores in the pore size distribution was revealed by our simulations which may be attributed to polymer dilation due a reduction in inter-chain packing.",,Published,,,2023-04-02T14:20:09

In this study, we show how confocal microscopy can be used as a reliable tool to visualize and quantify the heterogeneous pore space in carbonate materials. In confocal imagery, the quality of pore space images is controlled by various factors including the choice of fluorophore, objective lens, and medium of imaging. Our experiments demonstrated that there is no “fit-for-all” dye. The red dye provides more depth of investigation, while the blue dye can capture large pores more efficiently. Our investigation indicated that quantitative pore space description from confocal images can be significantly influenced by imaging artifacts associated with imaging the heterogeneous and complex pore space in carbonates. By applying image deconvolution, we mitigated the confocal imaging artifacts (e.g., spherical aberration, and resolution deviation), and extracted a more reliable 3D pore-network model of the carbonate sample. We employed our optimized confocal imaging protocol to visualize and quantify macro- and micropores, and more importantly their interconnectivity within an Indiana limestone (IL) sample. The computed pore-throat size distribution (PSD) from the 3D confocal images was able to capture the inherent bimodal distribution of IL.",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690785/1/1-s2.0-S0013795223000819-main.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690785/1-s2.0-S0013795223000819-main.pdf.txt,2023-04-02T10:40:10

Yet, further research is required to optimize their performance and competitiveness against packed columns. This work investigates the maximum wire density using the minimum pitch (center-to-center wire distance). Results show that the pitch can be smaller than two millimeters, which is significantly less than the minimum pitches recommended in the literature. Results are discussed for liquid flow rates, wire diameters, and counter-current gas velocities. The minimum pitch is often less than the diameter of the drops due to a bead-passing phenomenon. An analytical model illustrates the pressure drop characteristics of wetted-wire columns compared to existing packings. This model shows that wetted-wire columns including those with small pitches have very low pressure drops. However, this model also shows that packing factors do not adequately describe wetted-wire columns. This implies that gas-side fluid dynamics of wetted-wire columns are fundamentally different from the gas-side fluid dynamics of packed columns.",,Published,,,2023-04-02T10:30:09

In this work, we have evaluated the temperature evolution of a storage tank packed with HKUST-1 and subjected to a fast filling of methane under different external heat transfer conditions. When the tank is operated in adiabatic regime, the sudden temperature excursion damaged the HKUST-1 adsorbent with a reduction of 10% of its surface area.

Portico. https://doi.org/10.1002/csc2.20944","The National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) is a vital resource for genetic diversity, yet utilization of this resource requires a thorough understanding of the germplasm and genetic diversity. Intermediate wheatgrass (IWG, Thinopyrum intermedium) is a perennial grass species that has been improved for forage production through breeding utilizing the NPGS collection and has also been targeted for domestication as a perennial grain crop. To better characterize the IWG collection, we combined previously published forage data with new agronomic and genomic data. A total of 331 NPGS accessions were genomically profiled with genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) and a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was used to evaluate trait architecture. Along with the GWAS, in silico bulk samples were profiled by recoding GBS data to conduct association mapping through allele counting with extreme-phenotype (XP)-GWAS. Genomic analysis revealed two subpopulations, which were defined as European and Asian groups, and are differentiated around the Black Sea region. Phenotypic observations for forage and agronomic traits differed between the two groups (p < 0.05), even though greater than 70% of the genetic variance was partitioned within individual accessions. Finally, XP-GWAS revealed 303 marker–trait associations for five agronomic and four forage traits. These results suggest that genetic diversity within the NPGS collection should lead to genetic gains for both forage and grain breeding as well as opportunities for breeding programs to enhance genetic diversity. More broadly, the methods we applied could be applicable to low-resourced species, leveraging existing, and new data, to strengthen genetic characterization and breeding efficiency.",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690777/1/Crop%20Science%20-%202023%20-%20Crain%20-%20Genomic%20insights%20into%20the%20NPGS%20intermediate%20wheatgrass%20germplasm%20collection.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690777/Crop%20Science%20-%202023%20-%20Crain%20-%20Genomic%20insights%20into%20the%20NPGS%20intermediate%20wheatgrass%20germplasm%20collection.pdf.txt,2023-04-02T09:10:12

Groundmass plagioclase and clinopyroxene show gradual changes in texture and composition as flows grade from slowly cooled, meter-thick massive flows to more rapidly cooled dm-thick pillow lobes with quenched glassy margins. The corresponding change in cooling-rate is estimated to vary from <1 to ≥100 °C/h. With increasing cooling rate, plagioclase forms elongated, sector-zoned swallow-tail crystals. Sector zoning is associated with increasing FeO (up to 1.5 wt%) and MgO (up to 0.6 wt%) abundances at near-constant anorthite (An), related to a two orders of magnitude increase in growth rate. Sr, Ba, Li and Ti abundances remain constant and appear unaffected by kinetic factors at such growth rates. With increasing cooling rate clinopyroxene becomes dendritic, and its composition is sensitive to changes in crystallization conditions. Increasing cooling rate (<1 to ≥100 °C/h) leads to increasing Al2O3 (average of 3.2 to 4.3 wt%), TiO2 (1.3 to 2.8 wt%) and Na2O (0.37 to 0.44 wt%) and a decrease in SiO2 (50.1 to 46.4 wt%) and Mg#Fetot, i.e., molar MgO/(MgO + FeOtot), from 71.3 to 53.1. Trace element abundances (Y, Zr, Ce, V, Sr) in clinopyroxene increase by up to an order of magnitude at cooling rates ≥100 °C/h and become more heterogeneous spatially. These results support experimental evidence that rapid crystal growth leads to significant departure of mineral compositions from equilibrium, in particular for clinopyroxene. Although plagioclase composition remains relatively insensitive to changes in growth conditions at the studied cooling rates, the sensitivity of clinopyroxene composition to growth rates imply that it should be used with caution as a tool to infer magmatic crystallization conditions.",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690776/1/1-s2.0-S0009254123001158-main.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690776/1-s2.0-S0009254123001158-main.pdf.txt,2023-04-02T08:50:11

The growth rate in Non-Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (non-OECD) countries is four times higher than OECD as reported by The International Energy Agency. In Gulf Cooperation Council countries (GCC) countries, increasing population, rapid industrialization, and other societal factors such as the improved standard of living quality and growing water demand have caused drastic rise in primary energy. The water supply demand gap in GCC countries that cannot be filled by renewable water sources may be over 78% by 2050, and seawater desalination is the only practical solution for future supply increases. Today, all conventional desalination processes are only operating at 10%-13% of thermodynamic limit and consequently contribute huge amount of CO2 emission as well as brine rejection. From the perspective of sustainability, alternative energy sources and innovative processes are urgently required. In this chapter, a novel MgO-based solar thermal energy storage system is proposed as a part of a hybrid MEDAD desalination cycle. In the first phase, the hybrid MEDAD cycle operation has been demonstrated using a solar hot water storage system. In second phase, the hot water storage system will be replaced with MgO energy storage system that is under installation at this moment. The MgO thermal energy storage system can easily store heat at 120–140°C during hydration and dehydration operation, and it can be used for a thermal desalination system. Due to 100% solar operation, the proposed MgO + MEDAD cycle can satisfy sustainability goals.",,Published,,,2023-03-30T10:30:08

Islanding detection techniques allow for fast detection and corrective action in the face of abnormal events. Current standards specify the operational limits for voltage, frequency, and detection time. Grid codes specify the procedures for disconnection to establish safe network maintenance conditions. Passive and active techniques require voltage, current, and frequency measurements and the definition of thresholds for detection. Operational parameters such as load mismatch and quality factors influence the detection capabilities. Falsepositive triggering due to grid transients can lead to unnecessary disconnection of distributed generation resources. In this paper, we analyze the performance of several islanding detection techniques presented in the literature and propose a modified 9-bus benchmark system to verify the robustness of passive and active methods against false-positive detections upon severe gridside transients.

Here, we show how to use a wave-equation-based imaging method, reverse-time migration of precursors to surface-reflected seismic body waves, to uncover both mantle transition zone and mid-mantle discontinuities, and interpret their physical nature. We observe a thinned mantle transition zone southeast of Hawaii, and a reduction in impedance contrast around 410 km depth in the same area, suggesting a hotter-than-average mantle in the region. Here, we furthermore reveal a 4000-5000 km-wide reflector in new images of the mid mantle below the central Pacific, at 950-1050 km depth. This deep discontinuity exhibits strong topography and generates reflections with polarity opposite to those originating at the 660 km discontinuity, implying an impedance reversal near 1000 km. We link this mid-mantle discontinuity to the upper reaches of deflected mantle plumes upwelling in the region.

Such low-dose X-ray detection characteristics have been demonstrated with only a few direct-detection semiconductor materials such as Si and CdTe; however, their industrial deployment in medical diagnostics is still impeded by elaborate and costly fabrication processes. Hybrid metal halide perovskites – newcomer semiconductors -– make for a viable alternative owing to their scalable, inexpensive, robust, and versatile solution growth and recent demonstrations of single gamma-photon counting under high applied bias voltages. The major hurdle with perovskites as mixed electronic-ionic conductors, however, arises from the rapid material's degradation under high electric field, thus far used in perovskite X-ray detectors. Here we discuss the negative effects of the ion migration on X-ray detection performance and demonstrate the mitigation path by utilizing the perovskite X-ray detectors in the photovoltaic mode of operation at zero-voltage bias. We show both countings of almost every single incoming photon and long-term stable performance, by employing thick and uniform methylammonium lead iodide single crystal films, solution-grown directly on hole-transporting electrodes The operational device stability is equivalent to the intrinsic chemical shelf lifetime of MAPbI3, being at least one year in the studied case. Furthermore, direct readout array integration of detectors is demonstrated as well. A high spatial resolution of 11 lp mm-1 is obtained with a linear detector array. We also comment the lack of a clear commonly accepted X-ray detection characterization, approach, particularly in material research community, often leads to a misguiding assessment of performance.

Hybrid 2D/CMOS microchips for memristive applications. Nature. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-05973-1","Exploiting the excellent electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials to fabricate advanced electronic circuits is a major goal for the semiconductors industry1-2. However, most studies in this field have been limited to the fabrication and characterization of isolated large (>1µm2) devices on unfunctional SiO2/Si substrates. Some studies integrated monolayer graphene on silicon microchips as large-area (>500µm2) interconnection3 and as channel of large transistors (~16.5µm2)4-5, but in all cases the integration density was low, no computation was demonstrated, and manipulating monolayer 2D materials was challenging because native pinholes and cracks during transfer increase variability and reduce yield. Here we present the fabrication of high-integration-density 2D/CMOS hybrid microchips for memristive applications — CMOS stands for complementary metal oxide semiconductor. We transfer a sheet of multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) onto the back-end-of-line (BEOL) interconnections of silicon microchips containing CMOS transistors of the 180nm node, and finalize the circuits by patterning the top electrodes and interconnections. The CMOS transistors provide outstanding control over the currents across the h-BN memristors, which allows us to achieve endurances of ~5 million cycles in memristors as small as ~0.053µm2. We demonstrate in-memory computation by constructing logic gates, and measure spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) signals that are suitable for the implementation of spiking neural networks (SNN). The high performance and the relatively-high technology readiness level achieved represent a significant advance towards the integration of 2D materials in microelectronic products and memristive applications.",,Published,,,2023-03-29T14:00:09

In particular, the solid-state magneto-ionic means is highly appealing as it may allow reconfigurable electronics by transforming the all-important FM/AF interfaces through ionic migration. In this work, we demonstrate an approach that combines the chemically induced magneto-ionic effect with the electric field driving of nitrogen in the Ta/Co$_{0.7}$Fe$_{0.3}$/MnN/Ta structure to electrically manipulate exchange bias. Upon field-cooling the heterostructure, ionic diffusion of nitrogen from MnN into the Ta layers occurs. A significant exchange bias of 618 Oe at 300 K and 1484 Oe at 10 K is observed, which can be further enhanced after a voltage conditioning by 5 and 19%, respectively. This enhancement can be reversed by voltage conditioning with an opposite polarity. Nitrogen migration within the MnN layer and into the Ta capping layer cause the enhancement in exchange bias, which is observed in polarized neutron reflectometry studies.

Here, we combine genomics with participatory research to tap into traditional knowledge in smallholder farming systems, using durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) in Ethiopia as a case study. We developed and genotyped a large multiparental population, called the Ethiopian NAM (EtNAM), that recombines an elite international breeding line with Ethiopian traditional varieties maintained by local farmers. A total of 1,200 EtNAM lines were evaluated for agronomic performance and farmers’ appreciation in three locations in Ethiopia, finding that women and men farmers could skillfully identify the worth of wheat genotypes and their potential for local adaptation. We then trained a genomic selection (GS) model using farmer appreciation scores and found that its prediction accuracy over grain yield (GY) was higher than that of a benchmark GS model trained on GY. Finally, we used forward genetics approaches to identify marker–trait associations for agronomic traits and farmer appreciation scores. We produced genetic maps for individual EtNAM families and used them to support the characterization of genomic loci of breeding relevance with pleiotropic effects on phenology, yield, and farmer preference.

Design and Method: We derived and characterized 15 iPSC lines from four Saudi 47,XXY KS patients and one Saudi 46,XY male. We performed a comparative transcriptional analysis using the Saudi KS-iPSCs and a cohort of European and North American KS-iPSCs. Results: We identified a panel of X-linked and autosomal genes commonly dysregulated in Saudi and European/North American KS-iPSCs versus 46,XY controls. Our findings demonstrate that seven PAR1 and nine non-PAR escape genes are consistently dysregulated and mostly display comparable transcriptional levels in both groups. Finally, we focused on genes commonly dysregulated in both iPSC cohorts and identified several gene-ontology categories highly relevant to KS physiopathology, including shortened QT interval and aberrant cardiac muscle contractility, skeletal muscle defects, abnormal synaptic transmission, and behavioral alterations.

Thus, research endeavors are directed toward identifying AD biomarkers and targets. In this regard, we designed a computational method that exploits multiple hub gene ranking methods and feature selection methods with machine learning and deep learning to identify biomarkers and targets. First, we used three AD gene expression datasets to identify 1/ hub genes based on six ranking algorithms (Degree, Maximum Neighborhood Component (MNC), Maximal Clique Centrality (MCC), Betweenness Centrality (BC), Closeness Centrality, and Stress Centrality), 2/ gene subsets based on two feature selection methods (LASSO and Ridge). Then, we developed machine learning and deep learning models to determine the gene subset that best distinguishes AD samples from the healthy controls. This work shows that feature selection methods achieve better prediction performances than the hub gene sets. Beyond this, the five genes identified by both feature selection methods (LASSO and Ridge algorithms) achieved an AUC = 0.979. We further show that 70% of the upregulated hub genes (among the 28 overlapping hub genes) are AD targets based on a literature review and six miRNA (hsa-mir-16-5p, hsa-mir-34a-5p, hsa-mir-1-3p, hsa-mir-26a-5p, hsa-mir-93-5p, hsa-mir-155-5p) and one transcription factor, JUN, are associated with the upregulated hub genes. Furthermore, since 2020, four of the six microRNA were also shown to be potential AD targets. To our knowledge, this is the first work showing that such a small number of genes can distinguish AD samples from healthy controls with high accuracy and that overlapping upregulated hub genes can narrow the search space for potential novel targets.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690697/1/s41598-023-30904-5.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690697/s41598-023-30904-5.pdf.txt,2023-03-29T09:00:08

These exceptional properties have prompted the application of nanomaterials across the fields of chemistry, physics, materals science and biology. During the past decades, significant progress has been made on every aspect of the development of nanomaterials, from their synthesis to their characterization and to their applications. Among these advances, the technological and methodological innovations associated with the structural characterizations of nanomaterials have provided important insights into their structure-property relationships, bridged the gap between their synthesis and applications, and led to many groundbreaking scientific discoveries. In this volume, we introduce diverse characterization techniques and associated methods, with an emphasis on their importance to the development of nanomaterials. Many techniques have been developed to characterize nanomaterials in multi-dimensions and at multi-scales, using various probing particles or fields. These techniques allow comprehensive and correlated elucidation of the atomic, electronic, phononic and magnetic structures of nanomaterials, spanning the spatial, temporal, energy and momentum dimensions. When optical photons are used as the probing particles, such as in static/dynamic light scattering or vibrational spectroscopy, the morphological, structural, and vibrational properties of nanomaterials along with their dynamics can be collected, based on diverse elastic or inelastic scattering events. The X-ray photons that adopt a higher energy are predominantly scattered by the electrons of atoms and allow the atomic and electronic structures of nanomaterials to be probed over various coherence lengths by using diffraction- or absorption-based techniques. The electrons, as charged probing particles, feature much shorter wavelengths and stronger interactions with matter, and offer the possibility of direct imaging of the nanomaterials' structures down to atomic resolution via electron microscopy and associated techniques. Nanomaterials may also be probed by various fields arising from atomic and electrostatic forces as well as electric and magnetic dipoles, using scanning-probe microscopy/spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to provide surface- and/or bulk-sensitive structural information.

The underlying estimation problem is solved by steps that comprise obtaining the float solution, ambiguity resolution, and resolving the fixed solution. The analysis results show that the involvement of 5G observations can enable localization under satellite-deprived environments, inclusive of extreme cases with only 2 or 3 visible satellites.

Communication between AUV fleets is an urgent concern due to the data rate limitation of underwater acoustic communication. Laser-based underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) is a potential solution once the link-establishing requirement between AUVs can be met. Due to the limited coverage area of the laser beam, the previous pointing, acquisition, and tracking (PAT) method is to quickly adjust the beam direction and search for the target according to the set scanning path. We propose a scalable laser-based link establishment method that combines the maneuvering of the AUV, the acoustic positioning, and the control of the optical system for increased efficiency.

Here, three mitochondrial loci (coi, 12S rRNA, and 16S rRNA) were sequenced and morphological examinations were conducted at three scales (macro/micromorphology and microstructure of the skeleton, and polyp morphology) to study the phylogeny and taxonomy of Euphylliidae. We analysed a total of 11 valid species collected from seven Indo-Pacific localities. The monotypic genus Coeloseris, currently in Agariciidae, was also investigated since previous molecular data suggested a close relationship with the Euphylliidae. Molecular and morphological phylogenetic trees were broadly concordant in the definition of genus-level clades. All analysed genera, i.e., Ctenella, Euphyllia, Fimbriaphyllia, Galaxea, and Gyrosmilia, were reciprocally monophyletic based on molecular results. Coeloseris was nested within the family and, therefore, is formally moved into Euphylliidae. Updated morphological diagnoses are provided for each investigated genus. This study further demonstrated that a phylogenetic classification of scleractinian corals can be achieved by applying a combined morpho-molecular approach.

In this paper, two high-pressure shock tubes and a constant-volume reactor are used to measure ignition delay times and laminar flame speeds of TME oxidation. The ignition delay times were measured at equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 in “air”, at pressures of 5 and 10 bar, in the temperature range of 950 – 1500 K. Flame speeds of the TME/ “air” mixtures were measured at atmospheric pressure, at a temperature of 325 K, for equivalence ratios ranging from 0.78 to 1.31. Two detailed kinetic mechanisms were constructed independently using different methodologies; the KAUST TME mechanism was constructed based on NUIGMech1.1, and the MIT TME mechanism was built using the Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG).

Additionally, the trend for paediatric ED visits has decreased globally, secondary to implementing lockdowns to stop the spread of COVID-19. We aim to study the trend and characteristics of paediatric ED visits following Malaysia’s primary timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and materials: A five-year time series observational study of paediatric ED patients from two tertiary hospitals in Malaysia was conducted from March 17, 2017 (week 11 2017) to March 17, 2022 (week 12 2022). Aggregated weekly data were analysed using R statistical software version 4.2.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) against significant events during the COVID-19 pandemic to detect influential changepoints in the trend. The data collected were the number of ED visits, triage severity, visit outcomes and ED discharge diagnosis. Results: Overall, 175,737 paediatric ED visits were recorded with a median age of three years and predominantly males (56.8%). A 57.57% (p<0.00) reduction in the average weekly ED visits was observed during the Movement Control Order (MCO) period. Despite the increase in the proportion of urgent (odds ratio (OR): 1.23, p<0.00) and emergent or life-threatening (OR: 1.79, p<0.00) cases, the proportion of admissions decreased. Whilst the changepoints during the MCO indicated a rise in respiratory, fever or other infectious diseases, or gastrointestinal conditions, diagnosis of complications originating from the perinatal period declined from July 19, 2021 (week 29 2021). Conclusion: The incongruent change in disease severity and hospital admission reflects the potential effects of the healthcare system reform and socioeconomic impact as the pandemic evolves.

However, the network relies significantly on the training settings, such as imaging object and optical system parameters, resulting in a weak generalization ability. Here we propose a generalized Fourier-based PDWS method by combining an object-independent network with a system-independent image processing procedure. We demonstrate that a network trained with a specific setting can be applied to any image regardless of the actual settings. Experimental results show that a network trained with one setting can be applied to images with four other settings.

The tick-borne flavivirus group is transmitted amongst ticks and vertebrates. The nonstructural proteins of flaviviruses are suitable targets for inhibitory agents because of their role in pathogenicity. The RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase (NS5) enzyme is essential for replication of the TBEV genome. Therefore, it is the perfect target for developing drugs to control this viral infection. Here a computational study was performed to predict suitable inhibitors. Forty inhibitors including antiviral nucleoside analogues and their derivatives showed strong binding interactions with TBEV RdRp. Through comparison with positive controls, seventeen analogues displayed the best docking scores. Following an analysis of all docked complexes, it was observed that adenosine nucleoside analogues had the best docking scores and interactions with the active site residues. Specifically, the adenosine nucleoside analogues GS2, 3c, and 3e in their active triphosphate form had the best docking scores. All seventeen inhibitors were also subjected to ADMET and drug-likeness investigations, suggesting that they are sufficient to qualify as drug candidates. Among the selected docked conformations, the top three docked complexes were further subjected to molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the stability and dynamic behavior of docked complexes and to calculate their binding free energies. At the initial and intermediate time of simulation, all three inhibitors displayed fluctuations that shifted gradually to stability by the end of the simulation, validating the stability of the ligands within the active site of the enzyme. The interactions of inhibitors with the TBE virus RdRp target structure indicated that they established strong interactions inside the receptor's active sites. However, further in vitro and in vivo experimental studies are required to confirm their potential to inhibit and control TBE virus-associated infection.",,"Under Review",https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690672/1/SSRN-id4297304.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690672/SSRN-id4297304.pdf.txt,2023-03-27T15:30:09

One such approach is the integration of sensing and communications (ISAC) paradigms to jointly access the spectrum. Recent ISAC studies have focused on upper millimeter-wave and low terahertz bands to exploit ultrawide bandwidths. At these frequencies, hybrid beamformers that employ fewer radio-frequency chains are employed to offset expensive hardware but at the cost of lower multiplexing gains. Wideband hybrid beamforming also suffers from the beam-split effect arising from the subcarrier-independent (SI) analog beamformers. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a spatial path index modulation (SPIM) ISAC architecture, which transmits additional information bits via modulating the spatial paths between the base station and communications users. We design the SPIM-ISAC beamformers by first estimating both radar and communications parameters by developing beam-split-aware algorithms. Then, we propose to employ a family of hybrid beamforming techniques such as hybrid, SI, and subcarrier-dependent analog-only, and beam-split-aware beamformers. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed SPIM-ISAC approach exhibits significantly improved spectral efficiency performance in the presence of beam-split than that of even fully digital non-SPIM beamformers.",,"Under Review",https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690671/1/2303.12328.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690671/2303.12328.pdf.txt,2023-03-27T15:20:07

At the heart of the inversion process is the need for an accurate, and preferably flexible, eikonal solver to compute the travel time field. Most of the conventional eikonal solvers, however, suffer from first-order convergence errors and difficulties in dealing with irregular computational grids. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been introduced to tackle these problems and have shown great success in addressing those challenges. Nevertheless, these approaches still suffer from slow convergence and unstable training dynamics due to the multi-term nature of the loss function. To improve on this, we propose a new formulation for the isotropic eikonal equation, which imposes boundary conditions as hard constraints. We employ the theory of functional connections to the eikonal tomography problem, which allows for the utilization of a single loss term for training the PINN model. Through rigorous numerical tests, its efficiency, stability, and flexibility in tackling a variety of cases, including topography-dependent and 3D models, are attested, thus providing an efficient and stable PINN-based eikonal tomography.",,"Under Review",https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690670/1/958111_0_merged_1678263328.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690670/958111_0_merged_1678263328.pdf.txt,2023-03-27T15:10:09

Multiple monomeric subunits of GvpA and GvpC proteins form the GVNP shell, and several additional proteins are required as minor structural or assembly proteins. The haloarchaeal genetic system has been successfully used to produce and bioengineer GVNPs by fusing several foreign proteins with GvpC and has shown various applications, such as biocatalysis, diagnostics, bioimaging, drug delivery, and vaccine development. Results: We demonstrated that native GvpC can be removed in a low salt buffer during the GVNP purification, leaving the GvpA-based GVNP's shell intact and stable under physiological conditions. Here, we report a genetic engineering and chemical modification approach for functionalizing the major GVNP protein, GvpA. This novel approach is based on combinatorial cysteine mutagenesis within GvpA and genetic expansion of the N-terminal and C-terminal regions. Consequently, we generated GvpA single, double, and triple cysteine variant libraries and investigated the impact of mutations on the structure and physical shape of the GVNPs formed. We used a thiol–maleimide chemistry strategy to introduce the biotechnological relevant activity by maleimide-activated streptavidin–biotin and maleimide-activated SpyTag003-SpyCatcher003 mediated functionalization of GVNPs. Conclusion: The merger of these genetic and chemical functionalization approaches significantly extends these novel protein nanomaterials' bioengineering and functionalization potential to assemble catalytically active proteins, biomaterials, and vaccines onto one nanoparticle in a modular fashion.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690656/1/s12951-023-01866-7.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690656/s12951-023-01866-7.pdf.txt,2023-03-27T11:10:09

This study reports and attempts to explain this unique behavior. Biofilm density affects volumetric reaction rates, biofilm growth rates, substrate diffusion, and mechanical behavior. Yet the mechanisms and dynamics of biofilm density development are poorly understood. In this study, a membrane-aerated biofilm, where O2 was supplied from the base of the biofilm and acetate from the bulk liquid, was used to explore spatial and temporal patterns of density development. Biofilm density was assessed by optical coherence tomography. After inoculation, the biofilm quickly increased in thickness, with a low density throughout. However, as the biofilm reached a stable thickness of around 1000 μm, a high-density layer developed in the biofilm interior. The layer slowly expanded over time. Oxygen microprofiles in the biofilm showed this layer coincided with the most metabolically active zone, resulting from counter-diffusing O2 and acetate. The formation of this dense layer appeared to be related to changes in growth rates. Initially, high growth rates throughout the biofilm presumably led to fast-growing, low-density biofilms. As the biofilm became thicker, and as substrates became limiting in the biofilm interior, growth rates decreased, resulting in new growth at a higher density. A 1-D mathematical model with variable biofilm density was developed by linking the rates of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production to the growth rate. The model captured the initial fast growth at a low density, followed by a slower, substrate-limited growth in the biofilm interior, producing a dense band within the biofilm. Together, these results suggest that low growth rates can lead to high-density zones within the interior of counter-diffusional biofilms. These findings should also be relevant to conventional, co-diffusional biofilms, although differences in density may be less obvious.",,Published,,,2023-03-27T10:10:10

Slip accumulated during the faulting process alters also the petrophysical properties of the host rock. Although the mechanical alteration of the host rock, and related porosity and permeability changes, due to fault slip has been previously described, a predictive physics-based model has not been scaled with fault length in reservoirs to provide an initial porosity permeability alteration model yet. In this study, we develop a predictive model to quantify how accumulated fault slip changes porosity and permeability in a porous medium, by combining deformation modeling based on triangular dislocations and linearized poro-elasticity equations. We applied our model the Ghawar field fault map and rock-types. We conducted a Monte-Carlo simulation, varying fault roughness and accumulated slip, to quantify the corresponding variation in porosity and permeability using a 5 km long strike-slip fault and three different rock-types. Our Monte-Carlo simulation shows that long-term accumulated slip on rough strike-slip fault surfaces change porosity by ±1%, leading to an absolute permeability change of up to 22.5%. We further used these results as a benchmark for the elastic response of porous rocks to accumulated slip scaled to certain fault length. Using these benchmark results for Ghawar field reservoir rocks, we determined the slip-related porous medium permeability changes for every fault on the Ghawar fault map, accounting for their length, location, and orientation. In doing so, we found that fault roughness, slip amount, and shear sense all affect the medium's permeability, creating substantial permeability anisotropies. Locally, these anisotropies are further enhanced by superposition of permeability changes of individual faults that constitute the fault system. We suggest the resulting permeability distribution model should be used as the initial permeability model for porous media in fractured reservoirs.",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690650/1/1-s2.0-S1365160923000448-main.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690650/1-s2.0-S1365160923000448-main.pdf.txt,2023-03-27T09:40:11

Fuel, 344, 128118. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2023.128118","The soot properties of methane in turbulent regimes are not well characterised but are highly desirable. Methane is the main constituent of natural gas that is broadly used in many industrial combustors. Investigation of turbulent methane flames under well-defined boundary conditions is therefore useful for interpreting soot formation in practical burners and can be used for further model development. This study presents a joint experimental and numerical study of a series of turbulent non-premixed bluff-body flames fuelled with pure methane for three values of the momentum flux ratio of fuel jet to co-flowing air. Soot volume fraction (SVF) and flowfield are measured simultaneously using planar laser-induced incandescence (P-LII) and 2D-polarised particle image velocimetry (P-PIV). Additionally, time-averaged temperature, mixture fraction, OH and C2H2 concentrations are estimated numerically using RANS models. The global flame structure for all three flames features a recirculation zone with a double-vortex structure, a jet-propagating zone, and a neck zone connecting the two regions. The soot distribution within the recirculation zone shows clear distinct features, which is attributed to the mean mixture fraction distribution in this zone. Increasing the momentum flux ratio shifts the location of the mean stoichiometric mixture fraction to the rich inner vortex core, leading to a distinct peak of the total integrated soot in the inner vortex of the recirculation zone that is not observed in other cases. Also, it is deduced that the soot inception starts earlier in the recirculation zone for the flame with the highest momentum flux ratio and in the jet zone for the other two flames. Much higher soot concentration and lower intermittency are found with ethylene-based flames stabilised on the same burner and with the same operating conditions. In addition, the study has generated a database of soot and flowfield results, which can be helpful for future model validations.",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690649/1/1-s2.0-S0016236123007317-main.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690649/1-s2.0-S0016236123007317-main.pdf.txt,2023-03-27T09:30:15

Exposure to PM carries significant health risks such as lungs damage, heart disease, cancer, and death. PM2.5 is a subgroup of PM particles that are smaller than 2.5 µm and is a major concern as it is more harmful to health and more difficult to detect. One problematic component of PM2.5 is magnetite nanoparticles (<200 nm), which are readily absorbed into the bloodstream through the respiratory system. Eventually, magnetite nanoparticles deposit inside the brain causing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s or cancerous tumors by inducing oxidative stress. Additionally, Magnetite nanoparticles are often surrounded by heavy metal nanoparticles such as Cadmium and lead which are a great concern to the environment and health. Traditional PM detection methods such as laser scattering are bulky, expensive, and incapable of detecting particles smaller than 200 nm such as magnetite nanoparticles. Therefore, developing a low-cost highly sensitive sensor for monitoring magnetite nanoparticles is vital. Tunneling Magneto-Resistance (TMR) sensors are an attractive option due to their low-cost and high sensitivity toward magnetic nanoparticle detection. Moreover, developing a cheap, portable, and precise remote monitoring technique will allow for the creation of high spatial resolution highly sensitive monitoring networks for magnetic PM2.5.

The aim of this study is to examine the ElectroMagnetic Field (EMF) and throughput performance of a FWA deployment utilizing Standalone technology operating at 3.5 GHz. To address the unique characteristics of 5G FWA signals, an innovative framework has been designed based on the measurement of 5G FWA spectrum using four independent chains and an additional traffic generation chain to saturate the radio link capacity at the measurement location. Methodologies for evaluating 5G FWA exposure under conservative conditions, such as measurements of exposure during active traffic generation and maximum power extrapolations, are also introduced. Results from real measurements taken at a baseball stadium show that 5G FWA exposure is consistently low, typically below 0.4 V/m, with an upper bound of 0.59 V/m, while the achieved throughput is up to 250 Mbps. Additionally, the measured 5G exposure levels are a small fraction compared to those emitted by other technologies such as 4G.

The last decade has seen a proliferation in genomic resources for wheat, including reference- and pan-genome assemblies with gene annotations, which provide new opportunities to detect, characterise, and describe genes that influence traits of interest. The expansion of genetic information has supported growth of the wheat research community and catalysed strong interest in the genes that control agronomically important traits, such as yield, pathogen resistance, grain quality, and abiotic stress tolerance. To accommodate these developments, we present an updated set of guidelines for gene nomenclature in wheat. These guidelines can be used to describe loci identified based on morphological or phenotypic features or to name genes based on sequence information, such as similarity to genes characterised in other species or the biochemical properties of the encoded protein. The updated guidelines provide a flexible system that is not overly prescriptive but provides structure and a common framework for naming genes in wheat, which may be extended to related cereal species. We propose these guidelines be used henceforth by the wheat research community to facilitate integration of data from independent studies and allow broader and more efficient use of text and data mining approaches, which will ultimately help further accelerate wheat research and breeding.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690597/1/s00122-023-04253-w.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690597/s00122-023-04253-w.pdf.txt,2023-03-26T16:00:15

In this combustion mode, the mixing process is the key player that affect the flame structure and stability, as well as the generated emissions. Many studies have investigated the aspects that influence premixed flames, including the effects of turbulence, combustor geometry, and level of partial premixing, while mostly using conventional natural gas fuel represented by methane. Recently, ammonia, a sustainable energy source, has been considered in gas turbines due to its carbon-free fuel producing no CO2. Utilizing 100% ammonia or a blend of methane and ammonia alters the combustion performance of a premixed flame due to the variation associated with the physical and chemical properties of ammonia. Thus, investigating the coupling between blend ratios and mixing length of methane-ammonia on flame stability and emissions is an essential step toward implementing ammonia in industrial gas turbines. In this study, the influence of various methane-ammonia blends, from 0 (pure methane) to XNH3 = 75%, and mixing lengths on the flame performance were studied. The mixing length was altered by delaying the injection (i.e., partially premixing) of the ammonia while using a fixed injection location for the reference methane-air mixture. This was done by using three fuel ports located at three different heights upstream of the combustion chamber. The results showed that the flame stability is negatively influenced by increasing (decreasing) ammonia fraction (mixing length ratio) and is more sensitive to the ammonia fraction than to the mixing length. At a constant equivalence ratio, the CO and NOx performances improved positively by increasing the ammonia volume fractions (especially at XNH3 = 75% compared to XNH3 = 25% and 50%) and the mixing length.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690595/1/energies-16-02955-v2.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690595/energies-16-02955-v2.pdf.txt,2023-03-26T15:40:18

Essentially, the introduced forecasting models take advantage of the viscoelastic control model in flexibly controlling swarm robots and the capabilities of DL models to capture patterns in time series data. To this end, sensor measurements from a simulated swarm of foot bots conducting a circle formation task through the viscoelastic controller are recorded every 0.1 s and used as input vectors for forecasting purposes. The results show the promising performance of DL for swarm motion forecasting. Moreover, obtained results report that BiGRU reaches the highest swarm motion speed forecasting performance with the no/with obstacles scenarios considered in this study.",,Published,,,2023-03-26T15:20:13

Frontiers in Mechanical Engineering, 8. https://doi.org/10.3389/fmech.2022.889255","Multiple injection strategies can be used for controlling the heat release rate in an engine, particularly in compression ignition engines. This can mitigate the heat transfer losses and overcome the limitation related to the maximum pressure allowed for a particular engine. Controlling heat release with repetitive injections requires precise characterization of the fuel injection rates. In such a configuration, the injector used should be characterized for its hydraulic delay, rate of injection, and the effect of dwell timing with multiple injections. This study investigates the fuel injection behavior of a high-flow-rate solenoid injector operated with single and double injections. Two characterization methods, the momentum flux, and the Bosch tube are used and compared to investigate their suitability with the multiple injection strategies. Experiments with single injection are conducted by varying the Energizing Timing (ET) from 0.5 up to 2 ms. The tests with multiple injections (i.e., double injections) are conducted with a fixed ET of 0.5 ms, while the dwell times (Formula presented.) are varied from 0.1 up to 1 ms. All tests are performed at 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 bar rail pressures. Depending on the injection pressure, the injector’s needle could not fully close with short dwell times and the injections are merged. The momentum flux method has faster ramp-up and decaying and more oscillations in the quasi-steady-state phase compared to the Bosch tube method. The effective duration of injection is overpredicted with the Bosch tube method. The momentum flux method is demonstrated to be more suitable for measuring the ROI of multiple injection strategies.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690590/1/fmech-08-889255.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690590/fmech-08-889255.pdf.txt,2023-03-26T15:10:09

Energy & Fuels. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c00163","In this study, quartz substrates were incubated in sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) culture for 21 days at room temperature. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to quantify the bacterium effect, i.e., organic metabolite acids on the wetting behavior of the mineral surface. We examined the wettability of the quartz substrate before and after microorganism effects under reservoir conditions, i.e., 0 to 27 MPa pressures and 50 °C temperature. Nevertheless, there is no study reported to date for real geologic conditions, including for hydrogen–bacteria–rock wettability, which is proven to determine storage capacities, withdrawal rates, and containment security. Our findings reveal that the pH value of quartz dipped in the nutrient solution without SRB did not change meaningfully for 21 days. However, it significantly reduced from 7.58 to 5.98 with SRB. These microorganisms produce H2S, release the organic metabolite acids, and change the wettability of the mineral. The wettability of quartz surface changes from 4.2° to 14.4°, i.e., a 10.2% increase at 27 MPa and 50 °C after the bacterium effect. FTIR indicates the hydroxyl, amine, and carboxyl group (i.e., acetic acid) spectra in the microorganism solution. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) shows that the concentrations of sulfate (SO42− ), aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) have significantly reduced after the SRB effect. Overall, strong water-wet quartz shifted to less water-wet quartz after the microorganism effect under the reservoir conditions. SRB slightly reduce the residual trapping effect. Hence, this process might have enhanced the withdrawing efficiency of H2 in high brine-saturated sandstone reservoir rock under the microbial activity.",,Published,,,2023-03-26T14:00:09

Membrane technology consists of a solid background for the development of advanced sensors to detect pollutants. In fact, highly selective membranes responsible for the molecular recognition and/or selective capture of target analyte(s) are the core of highly sensitive sensors.

Preprint,"SEEING THROUGH THE CO2 PLUME: JOINT INVERSION-SEGMENTATION OF THE SLEIPNER 4D SEISMIC DATASET","Romero, Juan||Luiken, Nick||Ravasi, Matteo",,arXiv,,http://hdl.handle.net/10754/690553,2023-03-21,,"4D seismic inversion is the leading method to quantitatively monitor fluid flow dynamics in the subsurface, with applications ranging from enhanced oil recovery to subsurface CO2 storage. The process of inverting seismic data for reservoir properties is, however, a notoriously ill-posed inverse problem due to the band-limited and noisy nature of seismic data. This comes with additional challenges for 4D applications, given inaccuracies in the repeatability of the time-lapse acquisition surveys. Consequently, adding prior information to the inversion process in the form of properly crafted regularization terms is essential to obtain geologically meaningful subsurface models. Motivated by recent advances in the field of convex optimization, we propose a joint inversion-segmentation algorithm for 4D seismic inversion, which integrates Total-Variation and segmentation priors as a way to counteract the missing frequencies and noise present in 4D seismic data. The proposed inversion framework is applied to a pair of surveys from the open Sleipner 4D Seismic Dataset. Our method presents three main advantages over state-of-the-art least-squares inversion methods: 1. it produces high-resolution baseline and monitor acoustic models, 2. by leveraging similarities between multiple data, it mitigates the non-repeatable noise and better highlights the real time-lapse changes, and 3. it provides a volumetric classification of the acoustic impedance 4D difference model (time-lapse changes) based on user-defined classes, i.e., percentages of speed-up or slow-down in the subsurface. Such advantages may enable more robust stratigraphic/structural and quantitative 4D seismic interpretation and provide more accurate inputs for dynamic reservoir simulations. Alongside presenting our novel inversion method, in this work, we introduce a streamlined data pre-processing sequence for the 4D Sleipner post-stack seismic dataset, which includes time-shift estimation and well-to-seismic tie. Finally, we provide insights into the open-source framework for large-scale optimization that we used to implement the proposed algorithm in an efficient and scalable manner.",,"Under Review",https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690553/1/2303.11662.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690553/2303.11662.pdf.txt,2023-03-23T15:20:08

Primarily due to the low throughput in the experimental procedure, the need for such multi-property optimization causes the bottleneck in preclinical antibody discovery and development, because addressing one issue usually causes another. We developed a reinforcement learning (RL) method, named AB-Gen, for antibody library design using a generative pre-trained Transformer (GPT) as the policy network of the RL agent. We showed that this model can learn the antibody space of heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDRH3) and generate sequences with similar property distributions. Besides, when using HER2 as the target, the agent model of AB-Gen was able to generate novel CDRH3 sequences that fulfill multi-property constraints. 509 generated sequences were able to pass all property filters and three highly conserved residues were identified. The importance of these residues was further demonstrated by molecular dynamics simulations, which consolidated that the agent model was capable of grasping important information in this complex optimization task.

Current CL literature focuses on restricted access to previously seen data, while imposing no constraints on the computational budget for training. This is unreasonable for applications in-the-wild, where systems are primarily constrained by computational and time budgets, not storage. We revisit this problem with a large-scale benchmark and analyze the performance of traditional CL approaches in a compute-constrained setting, where effective memory samples used in training can be implicitly restricted as a consequence of limited computation. We conduct experiments evaluating various CL sampling strategies, distillation losses, and partial fine-tuning on two large-scale datasets, namely ImageNet2K and Continual Google Landmarks V2 in data incremental, class incremental, and time incremental settings. Through extensive experiments amounting to a total of over 1500 GPU-hours, we find that, under compute-constrained setting, traditional CL approaches, with no exception, fail to outperform a simple minimal baseline that samples uniformly from memory. Our conclusions are consistent in a different number of stream time steps, e.g., 20 to 200, and under several computational budgets.

With the rapid development of machine learning (ML) techniques, they are growing to substitute classical iterative solvers for speeding up flash calculations. However, conventional data-driven neural networks fail to account for physical constraints, like chemical potential equilibrium (equivalent to fugacity equality in the PT flash formulation) and interphase/intraphase mass conservation. In this work, we propose a physics-constrained neural network (PcNN) that first conserves both fugacity equality and mass balance constraints. To ease the inclusion of fugacity equality, it is reformulated in terms of equilibrium ratios and then introduced with a relaxation parameter such that phase split calculations are extended to the single-phase regime. This makes it technologically feasible to incorporate the fugacity equality constraint into the proposed PcNN model without any computational difficulty. The workflow for the development of the proposed PcNN model includes four steps. Step 1: Perform the constrained Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) to generate representative mixtures covering a variety of fluid types, including wet gas, gas condensate, volatile oil, and black oil. Step 2: Conduct PT flash calculations using the Peng-Robinson (PR) EOS for each fluid mixture. A wide range of reservoir pressures and temperatures are considered, from which we sample the training data for each fluid mixture through grid search. Step 3: Build an optimized PcNN model by including the fugacity equality and mass conservation constraints in the loss function. Bayesian optimization is used to determine the optimal hyperparameters. Step 4: Validate the PcNN model.

However, the governing EOR mechanisms of hydrocarbon recovery using NPS solutions are not yet explicit. Pore-scale visualization experiments clarify the dominant EOR mechanisms of fluid displacement and trapped/residual oil mobilization using NPS solutions. In this study, the influence of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), silicon dioxide (SiO2), and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) nanoparticles on the EOR properties of a conventional surfactant (sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate, SDBS) was investigated via experimental and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation approaches. Oil recovery was reduced with increased temperatures and micromodel heterogeneity. Adding nanoparticles to SDBS solutions decreases the fingering and channeling effect and increases the recovery factor. The simulation prediction results agreed with the experimental results, which demonstrated that the lowest amount of oil (37.84%) was retained with the micromodel after MWCNT-SDBS flooding. The oil within the micromodel after Al2O3-SDBS and SiO2-SDBS flooding was 58.48 and 43.42%, respectively.

The higher oil recovery and breakthrough time with MWCNTs could be attributed to their cylindrical shape, promoting the MWCNT-SDBS orientation at the liquid–liquid and solid–liquid interfaces to reduce the oil–water interfacial tension and contact angles significantly.

Herein, assembling reactive CoAl-layered metal oxide (LMO) into the gravity-driven catalytic membrane was carried out to overcome the inherent limitations. Indeed, compared to the conventional batch reactor (less than 35% removal), the LMO membrane/PMS system achieved effective degradation (94.17%) of the probe chemical ranitidine along with several other selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP, >80%). This, as predicted by density functional theory calculations, could be attributed to remarkable activation of PMS by the exposed (001) surfaces and (100) edges of CoAl-LMO, spontaneously generating ROS for PPCP degradation. Electron charge density difference analysis estimated efficient charge accumulation and depletion between PMS and LMO, implying strong interaction and charge transfer in the LMO membrane/PMS system. Notably, ROS quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed the theoretical findings, which showed that PPCP degradation in the LMO membrane/PMS system is caused by both the radicals (SO4•− + •OH = 51.97%) and nonradicals (1O2 = 20.58%) pathways. The LMO membrane achieved long-term stable performance (>90% removal), and the analysis of the used membrane suggested an increase in the relative distribution of oxygen vacancies or ≡Co–OH species, which is favourable for PMS activation.

RSC Advances, 13(14), 9333–9346. https://doi.org/10.1039/d3ra00395g","Nine tridentate Schiff base ligands of the type (N^N^O) were synthesized from reactions of primary amines {2-picolylamine (Py), N-phenyl-1,2-diaminobenzene (PhN), and N-phenyl-1,2-diaminoethane(EtN)} and salicylaldehyde derivatives {3-ethoxy (OEt), 4-diethylamine (NEt2) and 4-hydroxy (OH)}. Complexes with the general formula Pt(N^N^O)Cl were synthesized by reacting K2PtCl4 with the ligands in DMSO/ethanol mixtures. The ligands and their complexes were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. The DNA-binding behaviours of the platinum(II) complexes were investigated by two techniques, indicating good binding affinities and a two-stage binding process for seven complexes: intercalation followed by switching to a covalent binding mode over time. The other two complexes covalently bond to ct-DNA without intercalation. Theoretical calculations were used to shed light on the electronic and steric factors that lead to the difference in DNA-binding behavior. The reactions of some platinum complexes with guanine were investigated experimentally and theoretically. The binding of the complexes with bovine serum albumin (BSA) indicated a static interaction with higher binding affinities for the ethoxy-containing complexes. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values against MCF-7 and HepG2 cell lines suggest that platinum complexes with tridentate ligands of N-phenyl-o-phenylenediamine or pyridyl with 3-ethoxysalicylimine are good chemotherapeutic candidates. Pt-Py-OEt and Pt-PhN-OEt have IC50 values against MCF-7 of 13.27 and 10.97 μM, respectively, compared to 18.36 μM for cisplatin, while they have IC50 values against HepG2 of 6.99 and 10.15 μM, respectively, compared to 19.73 μM for cisplatin. The cell cycle interference behaviour with HepG2 of selected complexes is similar to that of cisplatin, suggesting apoptotic cell death.

This work proposes a robust history-matching workflow utilizing the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) network to perform history matching under uncertainties for geothermal resource development efficiently. There are mainly four steps. Step 1: Identifying uncertainty parameters. Step 2: The BiLSTM is built to map the nonlinear relationship between the key uncertainty parameters (e.g., injection rates, reservoir temperature, etc.) and time series outputs (temperature of producer). Bayesian optimization is used to automate the tuning process of the hyper-parameters. Step 3: The Bayesian MCMC is performed to inverse the uncertainty parameters. The BiLSTM is served as the forward model to reduce the computational expense. Step 4: If the errors of the predicted response between the high-fidelity model and Bayesian MCMC are high, we need to revisit the accuracy of the BiLSTM and the prior information on the uncertainty parameters. We demonstrate the proposed method using a 3D fractured geothermal reservoir, where the cold water is injected into a geothermal reservoir, and the energy is extracted by producing hot water in a producer. Results show that the proposed Bayesian MCMC and BiLSTM method can successfully inverse the uncertainty parameters with narrow uncertainties by comparing the inversed parameters and the ground truth. We then compare its superiority with models like PCE, Kriging, and SVR, and our method achieves the highest accuracy. We propose a Bayesian MCMC and BiLSTM-based history matching method for uncertainty parameters inversion and demonstrate its accuracy and robustness compared with other models. This approach provides an efficient and practical history-matching method for geothermal extraction with significant uncertainties.",,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690536/1/Parameter%20Inversion%20Using%20Markov%20Chain%20Monte%20Carlo%20and%20Deep%20Learning.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690536/Parameter%20Inversion%20Using%20Markov%20Chain%20Monte%20Carlo%20and%20Deep%20Learning.pdf.txt,2023-03-22T16:40:08

While the Covid19 pandemics induced obvious damages, the ""silent"" Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection induced liver damages are the main reason for liver transplantations. HCV-generated virus genome replication factories are housed within virus-induced intracellular structures termed membranous webs (MW) which are derived from the Endoplasmatic Reticulum (ER). Up to now, very advanced experimental data such as highly spatially resolved fluorescence and electron-tomography data often do not enter computational HCV viral RNA (vRNA) cycle models. Based upon diffusion-reaction partial differential equation (PDE) models, we are developing fully 3D resolved “in silico microscopes” to mirror in vitro / in vivo experiments of the intracellular vRNA cycle dynamics. Our first models described the major components (vRNA, non-structural viral proteins - NSPs - and a host factor). The next steps incorporated additional parameters: Different aggregate states of vRNA and NSPs, and population dynamics inspired diffusion and reaction coefficients instead of multilinear ones. Our work in progress framework presently is merging effects restricted to 2D manifold surface grids (e.g. ER surface, NSP diffusion) with others occurring in 3D volume meshes (e.g. cytosol, host factor supply). We estimate and incorporate realistic parameters such as NSP diffusion constants. The simulations are performed upon experimental data based reconstructed cell geometries and help understanding the relation of form and function of virus replication.

However, it is difficult to generate uniform subnanometer pores over large areas on 2D materials. Herein, we report that the well-defined defect structure of monolayer MoS2, namely, eight-membered ring (8-MR) pores typically formed at the boundaries of two antiparallel grains, can serve as molecular sieves for efficient water/ion separation. The 8-MR pores (4.2 × 2.4 Å) in monolayer MoS2 allow rapid single-file water transport while rejecting various hydrated ions. Further, the density of grain boundaries and, consequently, the density of pores can be tuned by regulating the nucleation density and size of MoS2 grains during the chemical vapor deposition process. The optimized MoS2 membrane exhibited an ultrahigh water/NaCl selectivity of ~6.5 × 104 at a water permeance of 232 mol m−2 h−1 bar−1, outperforming the state-of-the-art desalination membranes. When used for direct hydrogen production from seawater by combining the forward osmosis and electrochemical water splitting processes, the membrane achieved ~40 times the energy conversion efficiency of commercial polymeric membranes.

For this reason, estimating Carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV) is essential for diagnosing and analyzing different cardiovascular diseases. Despite its broader adoption in the clinical routine, the measurement process of carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity is considered a demanding task for clinicians and patients making it prone to inaccuracies and errors in the estimation. A smart non-invasive, and peripheral measurement of carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity could overcome the challenges of the classical assessment process and improve the quality of patient care. This paper proposes a novel methodology for the carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity estimation based on the use of the spectrogram representation from single non-invasive peripheral pulse wave signals [photoplethysmography (PPG) or blood pressure (BP)]. This methodology was tested using three feature extraction methods based on the semi-classical signal analysis (SCSA) method, the Law’s mask for texture energy extraction, and the central statistical moments. Finally, each feature method was fed into different machine learning models for the carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity estimation. The proposed methodology obtained an $R2\geq0.90$ for all the peripheral signals for the noise-free case using the MLP model, and for the different noise levels added to the original signal, the SCSA-based features with the MLP model presented an $R2\geq0.91$ for all the peripheral signals at the level of noise.

Unfortunately, most of the pump-probe characterization techniques are surface-insensitive and obtain information from the bulk due to the large penetration depth of the pulses. However, ultrafast scanning electron microscopy (USEM) is superior in visualizing carrier dynamics at the surface with high spatial-temporal resolution. Here, the authors successfully used USEM to uncover the tremendous effect of surface orientations and termination on the charge carrier of MAPbI3 perovskite single crystals. Time-resolved secondary electrons snapshots and density functional theory calculations clearly demonstrate that charge carrier diffusion, surface trap density, surface work function, and carrier concentration are strongly facet-dependent. The results display a diffusion length of 22 micrometers within 6.0 nanoseconds along (001) orientation. While (100) facet forms defect states that prevent carrier diffusion and shows an increase in the surface work function leading to dark contrast and fast charge carrier recombination.

The results of the study using fourier transformation showed that the estimated thickness of sediment amounted to 610.7 meters. Based on the east-west and north-south cross sections, the average estimated thickness of sediment is 557.4 meters and 664 meters, respectively. In short, the deeper sediment thickness of the sediment layer, will cause the amplification factor, that's make strengthening of the seismic waves so that the vibrations on the surface are getting stronger and make severe damage. Then, 3D model shows us that the subsurface structure is dominated by clay stone because the value of rock density distribution ranges from 1.6 gr/cm3 to 2.4 gr/cm3 with a density contrast value of -0.98 gr/cm3 to 1.9 gr/cm3.",,Published,,,2023-03-21T14:00:10

Herein, we report a proof-of-concept study on formulating confined bifunctional catalysts by linking catalytic species via non-covalent interactions (NCIs). Chiral phosphate and achiral cyclopropenium cations cross-assembled to give a confined bifunctional system for asymmetric bromo-semipinacol rearrangement. By changing the achiral catalyst to aminopyridine, the system can be applied to asymmetric bromocycloetherification. These reactions are largely optimized by simply changing the achiral catalyst.

Energy Reports, 9, 3248–3272. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2023.01.116","Utilization of bottom-of-the-barrel petroleum products like heavy fuel oils (HFO) derived from vacuum residue oils (VRO) is essential for the sustainable use of crude oil. The high sulfur content and asphaltenes with metallic impurities of these products, such as vanadium and nickel, lead to the production of criteria pollutants and inorganic ash upon combustion, which has limited their widespread use in many industries and jurisdictions. Industrially mature thermo-chemical conversion technologies (e.g., cracking, pyrolysis, partial oxidation (POx), and gasification) have been utilized to upgrade and convert oil residues like HFO into cleaner fuels such as syngas and hydrogen. Among these processes, commercial POx and gasification typically proceed via catalyst free-operations. However, the novel variants of gasification processes that can improve the utilization of heavy oil residues can be benefited from using catalysts. That is because not only can catalysts facilitate the reactions within a smaller reactor, but also they can provide better control over the product composition. Nevertheless, the typical characteristics of high carbon, impurities, and sulfur content lead to the deactivation of the solid-state catalysts mainly due to the coking and poisoning. The use of molten salts, metal/metal oxide as catalysts or oxygen carriers, and hydrogen peroxide as a gasifying agent in the gasification of heavy hydrocarbons are identified to offer significant potential to overcome these challenges, albeit introducing alternative difficulties. This paper surveys and briefly discusses the state-of-the-art thermo- and catalytic chemical conversion technologies for petroleum residue derived fuels, focusing on the use of molten catalysts, oxygen carriers, and hydrogen peroxide as oxidizing agents. The paper also briefly reviews methane pyrolysis, dry reforming with molten metal catalysts, and liquid chemical looping gasification to find similarities and know-how that can be used for gasifying heavy oil residues with the molten metal/metal oxides being used as either catalyst or reaction medium.",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690503/1/1-s2.0-S2352484723001245-main.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690503/1-s2.0-S2352484723001245-main.pdf.txt,2023-03-21T09:40:09

A number of technological developments in power and desalination sectors improved their efficiencies to save energy and carbon emission but still they are operating far from their thermodynamic limits. The theoretical thermodynamics limit for seawater desalination at normal conditions is about 0.78 kWh/m3 depending on the initial salt contents. However, practical plants are operated at several folds higher than this limit due mainly to inherent losses in the processes that were incurred in removing dissolved salts. Technological advancement in thermally driven processes hybridization have set the new bench mark for lowest energy consumption that has boosted the water production trend of desalination industry. In this paper, we presented multi-effect desalination (MED) hybridization with pressure swing adsorption (PSAD) cycle to overcome lower brine temperature limitations to boost overall performance of the system. The synergetic effect from hybridization of MED-PSAD permits a higher overall operational range and inter-stage temperature differences, leading to a boost in water production up to 2–3 folds. We showed that the proposed hybrid cycle can achieve highest performance SUPR = 20% of thermodynamic limit: one of the highest performance reported in the literature up till now. These figures can be translated to less than US$ 0.47/m3 – a lowest specific cost ever reported in the literature. The proposed cycle is not only tested at pilot scale, but also successfully commercialized into industry and received many international awards as one of the most efficient and sustainable desalination technology.",,Published,,,2023-03-20T17:00:09

They either ignore the temporal factor or miss heterogeneous information characterizing academic activities. More importantly, the detection results lack the interpretations of how research interests change over time, thus reducing the model's credibility.

We first construct temporal heterogeneous graphs to represent the research interests of the target authors. To make the detection interpretable, we design a deep neural network to parameterize the generation process of interpretation on the predicted results in the form of a weighted sub-graph. Additionally, to improve the training process, we propose a semantic-aware negative data sampling strategy to generate non-interesting auxiliary shift graphs as contrastive samples.

Relatively short DVB monolithic columns (18 cm long × 0.25 mm i.d.) incorporated with a tiny amount of sod-ZMOF nanoparticles (0.7 and 1.17 wt%) with an average particle size of 225 nm were successfully fabricated and used to separate linear alkanes and polar probes mixtures with increasing resolution up to 3.7 and 5.1 times, respectively, compared to a blank DVB monolithic column. A high-performance separation of linear alkanes series mixture (methane to decane) was exhibited in less than 2 min. McReynolds constants revealed that sod-ZMOF provided the composite monolith with a nonpolar character yielding a negative average polarity value smaller than the standard squalene column. An Excellent retention time of pentane and octane day-to-day reproducibility was achieved during 16 days and over more than 500 runs with RSD% of 2.25% and 3.3% using a composite monolithic column with 5 mg mL−1 sod-ZMOF (5-ZMOF@DVB).

Finally, successfully separating an azeotropic freon mixture of difluoromethane (R-32) and pentafluoroethane (R-125) was achieved with a selectivity of up to 4.84. A further thermodynamic study related the preferential adsorption of R-125 to entropic factors rather than enthalpic while trapping inside ZMOF pores. This work sheds light on utilizing the infinite diversity of MOFs and combining their properties with high permeability and easily fabricated organic monoliths for GC separations of light molecules and gasses.

Young and mature soot particles were extracted from laminar diffusion co-flow flames of NH3[sbnd]C2H4 blends up to 50% NH3. The soot nanostructure is examined using lattice fringe analysis of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images, Raman Spectroscopy, and Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS). The chemical composition of the soot surface is analyzed using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). With increasing NH3 addition, reduced planar growth of the soot graphitic layers is observed through the analysis of the soot nanostructure which indicates the suppression of carbon addition at the edge sites of the layer planes. It is also found that the carbon sp2/sp3 bonding ratio increases which shows a nanostructure with less carbon sp3 bonding at defect sites. By exploring the chemical composition, the nitrogen content of the soot surface increases with NH3 addition which is caused by the bonding of nitrogenated species with carbon at defect and edge sites of the carbon layer, reducing the potential for carbon addition, and thus soot growth. The results also show an increased risk of formation of nitrogenated polyaromatic hydrocarbons (N-PAHs) on the soot surface by NH3 addition.

Like the established multiresponsive field-effect transistors, multiresponsive OECTs can in principle be realised via blending, by combining multiple components with each one imparting a specific function to the device. Here we report the first example of an optically switchable OECT which is capable of undergoing a reversible modulation of its ON current by up to 30% upon irradiation with UV and visible light. By investigating the electrical characteristics of the channel material, in conjunction with the electronic characterisation performed by a macroscopic Kelvin probe technique and photoemission yield spectroscopy in air, we gained distinct insight into the electrochemical doping process occurring within the blend upon light irradiation. Such a proof-of-concept work opens perspectives towards the implementation of complex neuromorphic operations and algorithms in OECTs.",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690483/1/d2tc05444b.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690483/d2tc05444b.pdf.txt,2023-03-20T09:00:11

Remote Sensing of Environment, 287, 113489. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2023.113489","Accurately estimating river discharge from satellite-derived river hydraulic variables (e.g., width, height, and slope) is the overarching goal of the remote sensing of discharge (RSQ) community. Numerous past studies have developed and intercompared different RSQ algorithms to demonstrate their feasibility, yet relatively few have focused on assessing how the RSQ algorithms are adapted to a wide range of rivers globally. As the community is now ready to expand to the global scale given advances in computing power, sensors, and the launch of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission, a much broader geographic view of RSQ accuracy should be prioritized toward “better generalizability” instead of “higher accuracy at limited places”. To help close this gap, we extracted multi-temporal river widths from >350 K Landsat scenes at >3 K river reaches globally, and used them to estimate discharge using the Bayesian AMHG-Manning (BAM) algorithm and the geomorphologically-enhanced variant (geoBAM). We use this framework to demonstrate how to apply an ‘off the shelf’ RSQ algorithm and test it globally without methodological intervention and answer: does it live up to its promise? Our daily discharge inversions (1984–2019) showed positive Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) at 27% of the gauges for BAM and 39% for geoBAM, and this percentage increased to 46–65% after feeding richer priors on flow seasonality and monthly variability, amounting to 1400–2000 successful inversions. Exploratory analyses showed that the inversion is the most sensitive to a channel geomorphological parameter b and climate aridity, where the optimal conditions are high-b, humid environments, as well as moderate width variability, leaf area index (LAI), and river width. Although specific to BAM/geoBAM, constraining the factors to their optimal ranges led to a median KGE of 0.33 for >600 gauges, which highlights the promising potential for global RSQ. We further discussed the optimal configuration of the RS/priors by analyzing results derived from different information content in priors. Overall, our critical assessment of BAM/geoBAM reveals a successful global implementation of an existing algorithm that SWOT will improve. We suggest similar large-scale assessments for other RSQs be prioritized to identify the emerging challenges as we move into a new era with global river monitoring capability from space.",,Published,,,2023-03-20T08:50:12

However, the optimal tuning of the phase shifters at the RIS is a challenging task due to the passive nature of reflective elements and the high complexity of acquiring channel state information (CSI). Conventionally, wireless systems rely on pre-defined reflection beamforming codebooks for both initial access and data transmission. However, these existing pre-defined codebooks are commonly not adaptive to the environments. Moreover, identifying the best beam is typically performed using an exhaustive search that leads to high beam training overhead. To address these issues, this paper develops a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework that learns how to jointly optimize the active beamforming from the BS and the RIS-reflection beam codebook relying only on the received power measurements. To accelerate learning convergence and reduce the search space, the proposed model divides the RIS into multiple partitions and associates beam patterns to the surrounding environments with low computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed learning framework can learn optimized active BS beamforming and RIS reflection codebook. For instance, the proposed MA-DRL approach with only 6 beams outperforms a 256-beam discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook with a 97% beam training overhead reduction.",,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690427/1/1570839271%20final.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690427/1570839271%20final.pdf.txt,2023-03-19T15:50:06

Unfortunately, OCI learning can suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF) as the decision boundaries for old classes can become inaccurate when perturbated by new ones. Existing literature have applied the data augmentation (DA) to alleviate the model forgetting, while the role of DA in OCI has not been well understood so far. In this paper, we theoretically show that augmented samples with lower correlation to the original data are more effective in preventing forgetting. However, aggressive augmentation may also reduce the consistency between data and corresponding labels, which motivates us to exploit proper DA to boost the OCI performance and prevent the CF problem. We propose the Enhanced Mixup (EnMix) method that mixes the augmented samples and their labels simultaneously, which is shown to enhance the sample diversity while maintaining strong consistency with corresponding labels. Further, to solve the class imbalance problem, we design an Adaptive Mixup (AdpMix) method to calibrate the decision boundaries by mixing samples from both old and new classes and dynamically adjusting the label mixing ratio.

Using the sea anemone Aiptasia, we show that during symbiosis, the increased availability of glucose and the presence of the algae jointly induce the coordinated up-regulation and relocalization of glucose and ammonium transporters. These molecular responses are critical to support symbiont functioning and organism-wide nitrogen assimilation through glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase–mediated amino acid biosynthesis.

In this study, the impact of the contact work function on the obtained passivation is examined and quantified using a novel method—quasi-steady-state photoluminescence—which provides access to the surface saturation current density after metallisation (J0s,m). The obtained J0s,m indicates an improvement of the surface passivation when contacts with high work function are applied onto Si wafers passivated with aluminium oxide, regardless of the wafer doping type. This improvement is mainly due to the amplification of the imbalance between the electron and hole concentrations near the Si interface. The passivation quality is reduced when using contacts with low work function in which the recombination rate increases via the charge-assisted carrier population control.

Coastal shelter forests as one of vegetated coastal ecosystems play vital role on sandy coasts protection, but less attention is paid on their soil organic carbon (OC) sequestration potential. Here, we provide the first national-scale assessment of the soil OC stocks, fractions, sources and accumulation rates from 48 sites of shelter forests and 74 sites of sandy beaches across 22° of latitude in China. We find that, compared with sandy beaches, shelter forest plantation achieves an average soil desalination rate of 92.0 % and reduces the soil pH by 1.3 units. The improved soil quality can facilitate OC sequestration leading to an increase of soil OC stock of 11.8 (0.60–64.2) MgC ha−1 in shelter forests. Particulate OC (POC) is a dominant OC fraction in both sandy beaches and shelter forests, but most sites are >80 % in shelter forests. The low δ13C values and higher C:N ratios, which are more regulated by climate and tree species, together with high POC proportions suggest a substantial contribution of plant-derived OC. Bayesian mixing model indicates that 71.8 (33.5–91.6)% of the soil OC is derived from local plant biomass. We estimate that soil OC stocks in Chinese shelter forests are 20.5 (7.44–79.7) MgC ha−1 and 4.53 ± 0.71 TgC in the top meter, with an accumulation rate of 45.0 (6.90 to 194.1) gC m−2 year−1 and 99.5 ± 44.9 GgC year−1. According to coastal shelter forest afforestation plan, additional 1.72 ± 0.27 TgC with a rate of 37.9 ± 17.1 GgC year−1 can be sequestrated in the future.

This study examines the volumetric and shear response of a uniform quarzitic sand subjected to repetitive drained simple shear loading under constant vertical stress while tracking the evolution of the secant stiffness and the small-strain shear modulus. We explore the effects of initial density, initial shear stress and cyclic shear stress amplitude to identify criteria that can be used to anticipate asymptotic volumetric and shear states. We analyze experimental results in reference to the sand response under monotonic simple shear loading. All specimens evolved toward some asymptotic terminal void ratio eT when subjected to simple shear cycles. Contractive specimens exhibited unceasing shear strain accumulation and ratcheting when the normalized shear stress exceeded τ∗=(τo+Δτ)/τult>0.85; on the other hand, dense-dilative specimens exhibited ratcheting only when the normalized shear stress exceeded τ∗=(τo+Δτ)/τult>1.25. The small-strain Gmax and the secant Gpp shear moduli increased during repetitive shear cycles to reflect early fabric changes followed by abrasion/fretting among enduring contacts.

Methamphetamine use during pregnancy, even at therapeutic doses, may harm fetal development. Here, we examined whether exposure to methamphetamine affects the morphogenesis and diversity of ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons (VMDNs). The effects of methamphetamine on morphogenesis, viability, the release of mediator chemicals (such as ATP), and the expression of genes involved in neurogenesis were evaluated using VMDNs isolated from the embryos of timed-mated mice on embryonic day 12.5. We demonstrated that methamphetamine (10 µM; equivalent to its therapeutic dose) did not affect the viability and morphogenesis of VMDNs, but it reduced the ATP release negligibly. It significantly downregulated Lmx1a, En1, Pitx3, Th, Chl1, Dat, and Drd1 but did not affect Nurr1 or Bdnf expression. Our results illustrate that methamphetamine could impair VMDN differentiation by altering the expression of important neurogenesis-related genes. Overall, this study suggests that methamphetamine use may impair VMDNs in the fetus if taken during pregnancy.

Briefings in Bioinformatics. https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbad093","Accurate prediction of promoter regions driving miRNA gene expression has become a major challenge due to the lack of annotation information for pri-miRNA transcripts. This defect hinders our understanding of miRNA-mediated regulatory networks. Some algorithms have been designed during the past decade to detect miRNA promoters. However, these methods rely on biosignal data such as CpG islands and still need to be improved. Here, we propose miProBERT, a BERT-based model for predicting promoters directly from gene sequences without using any structural or biological signals. According to our information, it is the first time a BERT-based model has been employed to identify miRNA promoters. We use the pre-trained model DNABERT, fine-tune the pre-trained model on the gene promoter dataset so that the model includes information about the richer biological properties of promoter sequences in its representation, and then systematically scan the upstream regions of each intergenic miRNA using the fine-tuned model. About, 665 miRNA promoters are found. The innovative use of a random substitution strategy to construct a negative dataset improves the discriminative ability of the model and further reduces the false positive rate (FPR) to as low as 0.0421. On independent datasets, miProBERT outperformed other gene promoter prediction methods. With comparison on 33 experimentally validated miRNA promoter datasets, miProBERT significantly outperformed previously developed miRNA promoter prediction programs with 78.13% precision and 75.76% recall. We further verify the predicted promoter regions by analyzing conservation, CpG content and histone marks. The effectiveness and robustness of miProBERT are highlighted.",,Published,,,2023-03-19T11:20:15

Among the multiple single-cell data, GCN-SC usually selects one data with the largest number of cells as the reference and the rest as the query dataset. It utilizes mutual nearest neighbor algorithm to identify cell-pairs, which provide connections between cells both within and across the reference and query datasets. A GCN algorithm further takes the mixed graph constructed from these cell-pairs to adjust count matrices from the query datasets. Finally, dimension reduction is performed by using non-negative matrix factorization before visualization. By applying GCN-SC on six datasets, we show that GCN-SC can effectively integrate sequencing data from multiple single-cell sequencing technologies, species or different omics, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, including Seurat, LIGER, GLUER and Pamona.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690408/1/bbad081.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690408/bbad081.pdf.txt,2023-03-19T11:10:11

To circumvent this limitation, we screened mice engineered to carry eight MM lesions (NF-κB, KRAS, MYC, TP53, BCL2, cyclin D1, MMSET/NSD2 and c-MAF) combinatorially activated in B lymphocytes following T cell-driven immunization. Fifteen genetically diverse models developed bone marrow (BM) tumors fulfilling MM pathogenesis. Integrative analyses of ∼500 mice and ∼1,000 patients revealed a common MAPK–MYC genetic pathway that accelerated time to progression from precursor states across genetically heterogeneous MM. MYC-dependent time to progression conditioned immune evasion mechanisms that remodeled the BM microenvironment differently. Rapid MYC-driven progressors exhibited a high number of activated/exhausted CD8+ T cells with reduced immunosuppressive regulatory T (Treg) cells, while late MYC acquisition in slow progressors was associated with lower CD8+ T cell infiltration and more abundant Treg cells. Single-cell transcriptomics and functional assays defined a high ratio of CD8+ T cells versus Treg cells as a predictor of response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). In clinical series, high CD8+ T/Treg cell ratios underlie early progression in untreated smoldering MM, and correlated with early relapse in newly diagnosed patients with MM under Len/Dex therapy. In ICB-refractory MM models, increasing CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity or depleting Treg cells reversed immunotherapy resistance and yielded prolonged MM control. Our experimental models enable the correlation of MM genetic and immunological traits with preclinical therapy responses, which may inform the next-generation immunotherapy trials.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690407/1/s41591-022-02178-3.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690407/s41591-022-02178-3.pdf.txt,2023-03-19T10:40:07

We examined how a mixture of these species may influence the biochemical attributes and fungal community associated with leaf litter, and the effects on litter decomposition. We studied the litter from pure and mixed plantations, evaluating the effects of plant material and incubation site on the mycobiome and decomposition rate using litterbags incubated in situ. Our central hypothesis was litter fungal community would change according to incubation site, and it would interfere in litter decomposition rate. Both the plant material and the incubation locale significantly affected the litter decomposition. The origin of the litter was the main modulator of the mycobiome, with distinct communities from one plant species to another. The community changed with the incubation time but the incubation site did not influence the mycobiome community. Our data showed that litter and soil did not share the main elements of the community. Contrary to our hypothesis, the microbial community structure and diversity lacked any association with the decomposition rate.

In this study, the presence of HAB species and their appearance patterns were investigated by employing molecular and light microscopy-based monitoring in Tokyo Bay, Japan. The potential co-appearance patterns between the HAB species, as well as with other eukaryotes and prokaryotes were investigated using correlation and association rule-based time-series analysis. In total, 40 unique HAB species were detected, including 12 toxin-producing HAB species previously not reported from the area. More than half of the HAB species were present throughout the sampling season (summer to autumn) and no structuring or succession patterns associated with the environmental conditions could be detected. Statistically significant (p < 0.05, rS ranging from −0.88 to 0.90) associations were found amongst the HAB species and other eukaryotic and prokaryotic species, including genera containing growth-limiting bacteria. However, significant correlations between species differed amongst the years, indicating that variability in environmental conditions between the years may have a stronger influence on the microalgal community structure and interspecies interactions than the variability during the sampling season. The association rule-based time-series analysis allowed the detection of a previously reported negative relationship between Synechococcus sp. and Skeletonema sp. in nature.

Pervaporation is a promising option for the separation of bio-alcohols from the fermentation mixture. A serious problem in the process of continuous extraction of biobutanol from the fermentation broth is the contamination of the membrane, which leads to a decrease in its permeability over time. In this work, the transport properties of composite membranes based on polyheptylmethylsiloxane (PHeptMS), polydecylmethylsiloxane (PDecMS), and a commercial membrane MDK-3 were studied during separation of a real ABE-fermentation broth in vacuum pervaporation mode. The study was performed before and after continuous contact of the membranes with the fermentation broth for one month. Visually and by scanning electron spectroscopy, the presence of membrane surface residue and its effect on the wettability of the membrane selective layer by the components of the ABE broth were determined. The sediment composition was evaluated by energy dispersive analysis and infrared spectroscopy. According to the pervaporation separation of the ABE-broth using PHeptMS, PDecMS, and MDK-3 membranes, the butanol flux was 0.029, 0.012, and 0.054 kg/(m2·h), respectively.

After one month of incubation of the membranes in ABE-fermentation broth during the separation of the model mixture, a decrease of 10 and 5% in permeate flux and separation factor, respectively, was observed for all membranes. Temperature dependences (30–60 °C) of permeate flux, permeability, and selectivity were obtained for the membranes after clogging. The most promising in terms of minimal negative changes as a result of fouling was demonstrated by the PHeptMS membrane. For it, the clogging dynamics during separation of the real fermentation broth for 216 h were investigated. Two characteristic steps of decrease in transport and separation properties were observed, after 28 and 150 h of the experiment. After 216 h of experiment, a 1.28-fold decrease in total flux through the membrane, a 9% decrease in butanol permeability, and a 10% decrease in n-butanol selectivity were found for PHeptMS.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690400/1/applsci-13-03827-v2.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690400/applsci-13-03827-v2.pdf.txt,2023-03-19T08:50:10

ZIF thin films have been pursued intensively motivated by the desire to prepare membranes for selective gas and liquid separations. To achieve membranes with high throughput, as in Å-scale biological channels with nanometer-scale pathlengths, ZIF films with the minimum possible thickness, down to just one unit cell, are highly desired. Control of ZIF film thickness at the 10-nm-scale may also enable emerging, MOF-inspired, applications including patterned crystalline MOF films, and amorphous organic-inorganic resists for high-resolution electron-beam (e-beam) and extreme UV (EUV) lithography. However, the state-of-the-art methods yield ZIF films with thicknesses exceeding 40 nanometers. Here, we report a deposition method from ultra-dilute precursor mixtures that within minutes yields uniform ZIF deposits with nm-scale thickness control. On crystalline substrate such as graphene, two-dimensional crystalline ZIF (2DZIF) film with thickness of a unit-cell could be achieved, which composed of a six-membered zincimidazolate coordination ring enabling record-high H2 permselective separation performance. Deposition under identical conditions on amorphous substrates yields macroscopically smooth amorphous ZIF (aZIF) films, which can be used as negative- and positive-tone resists yielding pattern features down to 20 nm.

One attractive option is the gasification of residual fuels, such as heavy fuels, which produce clean combustible gases. Pyrolysis is the first step in the gasification process, so its understanding can help in the development of the gasification process. The information on the pyrolysis products can serve the development of chemical kinetics mechanisms for gasification of heavy fuels for their efficient utilization. In this study, pyrolysis of heavy fuel oil (HFO) and vacuum residue oil (VRO) is reported. Prior to the pyrolysis experiments, these fuels were characterized for proximate analysis, elemental and trace metal composition. The pyrolysis experiments were conducted in a wide temperature range of 400–1000 °C in a customized tubular furnace-based reactor. A two-stage condensation system was used to collect the condensable fraction evolved from the pyrolysis of HFO and VRO and non-condensable gases were collected in Tedlar® bags. Both liquid and gaseous products were characterized using a gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS)-flame ionization detector (FID) and Fourier transform–ion cyclotron resonance–mass spectrometer (FT-ICR-MS) to understand the presence of different types of compounds. The identified compounds were classified as benzene derivatives, naphthalene derivatives, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons and sulfur-containing compounds. In order to better understand the liquid fraction, the heavy fraction (with high molecular weight) which could not be analyzed and identified in GC/MS-FID was analyzed in FT-ICR-MS. This shed significant insights on the deconstruction of HFO and VRO. Twenty lighter hydrocarbons ranging from C1-C5 were identified and quantified in the pyrolysis vapors of both fuels.",,"Under Review",https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690393/1/SSRN-id4385837.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690393/SSRN-id4385837.pdf.txt,2023-03-16T14:50:11

GRU enhances the AE's ability to learn temporal dependencies, and the AM enables the selection of relevant features.

However, it is challenging to achieve a high MTF using traditional large-NA lenses, which are fundamentally limited by the amplitude mismatch. In contrast, metasurfaces are promising for realizing amplitude and phase matching for ideal lenses. However, current metalenses are mostly based on a phase-only (PO) profile because the strong coupling among the metaatoms in large-NA lenses makes perfect amplitude matching quite challenging to realize. Here, we derive a phase-and-amplitude (PA) profile that approaches the theoretical MTF limit for large-NA lenses and use interferometric unit cells combined with a segmented sampling approach to achieve the desired amplitude and phase control. For the first time, we show that the amplitude does not require a perfect match; realizing the trend of the required amplitude is sufficient to significantly increase the MTF of a large-NA lens. We demonstrated a 0.9 NA cylindrical metalens at 940 nm with a Struve ratio (SR), which describes how close the MTF is to the upper limit, increasing from 0.68 to 0.90 compared with the PO metalens. Experimentally, we achieved an SR of 0.77 for the 0.9 NA lens, which is even 0.09 higher than the simulated SR of the PO metalens.

In studying brain signals such as electroencephalograms (EEG), this may be explored via Granger causality (GC) which tests if knowledge of the past values of a channel improves predictions on future values of another channel. However, the common approach to investigating GC is the vector autoregressive (VAR) model which is limited only to linear lead-lag relations. An alternative information-theoretic causal measure, transfer entropy (TE), becomes more appropriate since it does not impose any distributional assumption on the variables and covers any form of relationship (beyond linear) between them. To improve utility of TE in brain signal analysis, we propose a novel methodology to capture cross-channel information transfer in the frequency domain. Specifically, we introduce a new measure, the spectral transfer entropy (STE), to quantify the magnitude and direction of information flow from a certain frequency-band oscillation of a channel to an oscillation of another channel. In contrast with previous works on TE in the frequency domain, we differentiate our work by considering the magnitude of filtered series (frequency band-specific), instead of using the spectral representation (frequency-specific) of a series. The main advantage of our proposed approach is that it allows adjustments for multiple comparisons to control family-wise error rate (FWER). One novel contribution is a simple yet efficient estimation method based on vine copula theory that enables estimates to capture zero (boundary point) without the need for bias adjustments.

Established eddy detection techniques rely on physical or geometric criteria, and they notoriously fail to predict eddies that are neither circular nor elliptical in shape. Recently, deep learning techniques have been applied for semantic segmentation of mesoscale eddies, relying on the outputs of traditional eddy detection algorithms to supervise the training of the neural network. However, this approach limits the network’s predictions because the available annotations are either circular or elliptical. Moreover, current approaches depend on the sea-surface height, temperature, or currents as inputs to the network, and these data may not provide all the information necessary to accurately segment eddies. In the present work, we have trained a neural network for the semantic segmentation of eddies using human-based—and expert-validated—annotations of eddies in the Arabian Sea. Training with human-annotated datasets enables the network predictions to include more complex geometries, which occur commonly in the real ocean. We then examine the impact of different combinations of input surface variables on the segmentation performance of the network. The results indicate that providing additional surface variables as inputs to the network improves the accuracy of the predictions by approximately 5%.

In the available literature, identifying the correlation between states governed by the dynamic equations and the parameter estimate of different subspaces of multiphase IM remains scarce, especially under unbalanced conditions, where the effect of secondary subspaces sounds influential. Most available literature has relied on simple RL circuit representation to model these secondary subspaces. To this end, this paper presents an effective data-driven-based space harmonic model for n-phase IMs using sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover the IM governing equations. Moreover, the proposed approach is computationally efficient, and it precisely identifies both the electrical and mechanical dynamics of all subspaces of an IM using a single transient startup run. Additionally, the derived model can be reformulated into the standard canonical form of the induction machine model to easily extract the parameters of all subspaces based on online measurements.

Furthermore, there is a belief in the importance of the task forces within the community as part of an emergency response plan, and a less reflective system would have less recovery speed. Therefore, the rapidity characteristic of a built environmental system to accept the change and uncertainty inherited from the past or generated over time is correlated to the system’s reflectivity quality. This study emphasizes the significant correlation between the different RQ traits. It also encourages researchers to formulate more objective methods to reach a set form for measuring RQs as an engineering standard.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690347/1/sustainability-15-05055-v2.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690347/sustainability-15-05055-v2.pdf.txt,2023-03-15T11:00:06

Significantly, with rational decoration of a ruthenium-oxides (RuOx) layer on nanowires guided by theoretical modeling, the resulted RuOx/p-n GaN photoelectrode exhibits unambiguously boosted bipolar photoresponse by an enhancement of 775% and 3000% for positive and negative photocurrents, respectively, compared to the pristine nanowires. The loading of RuOx layer on nanowire surface optimizes surface band bending which facilitates charge transfer across the GaN/electrolyte interface, meanwhile promoting the efficiency of redox reaction for both hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction which corresponds to the negative and positive photocurrents, respectively.

While their thermal tolerance is well described, little is known about their resistance to ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB). Here, we performed a short-term (2 days) UVB-removal incubation with Stylophora pistillata, and in situ measurements with Pocillopora verrucosa complemented by a long-term (46 days) transplantation and UVB-removal experiment. Using a suite of physiological parameters (effective quantum yield (Fv’/Fm’), oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation, LPO), and primary production), we assessed the impacts of UVB on the physiology and acclimation capacity of Red Sea corals. Shielding S. pistillata from UVB did not change the gross primary production or Fv’/Fm’, and respiration and LPO in the host remained unaffected. In situ, P. verrucosa exhibited less varying and significantly higher Fv’/Fm’ in 8 m depth (0.61 ± 0.04) than in 4 m (0.52 ± 0.06), 2 m (0.51 ± 0.09), and 0.5 m (0.50 ± 0.11), where water temperatures ranged from 30.5–33.4, 30.6–34.0, 30.8–34.5, 30.6–37.3°C and daily UVB exposures averaged 0.9, 2.9, 11.8 and 21.4 kJ m-2, respectively. Fv’/Fm’ correlated the strongest with UVB (-0.57), followed by PAR (-0.54) and temperature (-0.40), suggesting that UVB is a key determinant of photosynthetic efficiency. Fv’/Fm’ of upward transplanted specimens (T 1m) was initially decreased but gradually increased and reached the same values as shallow corals (1 m) after 44 days. UVB removal significantly increased the Fv’/Fm’ of transplanted corals in the first 20 days. Oxidative stress was initially highest in T 1m samples under full sunlight but equalized with 1 m specimens by day 46, whereas oxidative stress was significantly reduced by day 4 in T 1m corals sheltered from UVB. Overall, UVB-removal generally had little impact on the physiology of shallow-water S. pistillata and P. verrucosa but considerably accelerated the acclimation of upward transplanted corals.

However, a large portion of the required energy is stored elastically in the stretching ligaments, which lead to sudden catastrophic debonding after the failure of ligaments. Two improvement methods are summarized in this work to further promote energy dissipation and slow down the catastrophic debonding. Integrating polyamide wires within the epoxy adhesive layer introduced complex failure mechanisms and bridging of embedded wires, while adopting a more ductile adhesive could largely extend the size of the bridging zone.

A well-known example is the transverse crack induced local delamination. In the early stage of loading, the matrix is prone to diffuse matrix damage, followed by macroscopic transverse cracks. Stress concentration in the crack tip would then leads to local delamination in the interlaminar region. In this work, we implemented both experimental and numerical study to dig into the intra/inter laminar coupling mechanism. Our experiments indicated that preset intralaminar damage could be both detrimental and helpful to the interlaminar damage performance [1]. In one aspect, the transverse crack induced delamination will decrease the delamination resistance. In the other aspect, the preset intralaminar damage could cause crack branch inside the layers during delamination progress. The arrested delamination crack would pull out fiber bridging in mode I fracture. Both the wavy delamination crack and pulled out fiber bridging will, in the end, prohibit delamination propagation and dissipate more energy. Furthermore, we proposed a hybrid cohesive element to involve the coupling mechanism [2]. In this hybrid cohesive element, we not only use the classical displacement jump, but also the displacement field of the top and bottom surface of the cohesive element. The displacement field of the cohesive element's top and bottom surface is used to estimate the strain and damage level of the adjacent layers of this interested interface.

Our solution is based on creating multiple sensing regions within the area of a single capacitive sensor body by considering the sensor as an analogical transmission line, reducing the connections to only two wires and simplifying the electronic interface. The proposed distributed sensor is a stretchable parallel-plate capacitor comprising two cracked electrodes separated by a dielectric layer. The piezoresistivity of the electrodes induces the transmission-line behavior in the entire sensor at radio frequencies. The transmission line behavior allows the sensing signal to be attenuated by high-resistance electrodes along the capacitive sensor's length. Different regions of the capacitive sensor can then be moitored by changing the sensing frequency and creating a virtual sensor length.

With this broad range of applications, smart and intelligent biomaterials are used separately or in combination with 3D printing to enable the design of eco-friendly and sustainable solutions that can be used to overcome challenges for both; modern medicine and the environment.",,Published,,,2023-03-14T08:50:07

It is based upon a simple viscous rheological model and steady-state tectonic strain loading. Creep data reveals different viscoelastic behavior of rocks mostly controlled by the varying mineral composition and the direction of creep measurement (perpendicular/parallel to the bedding plane). First, this approach is applied in a vertical drilled well then verify in another vertical well located in the Canning Basin where the target resources are ultralow permeable unconventional gas shale reservoirs. A continuous Shmin magnitude profile at depth is obtained from wireline logs through the following: (i) combination of laboratory power-law fitting coefficients, (ii) geological horizontal stress accumulation by constant tectonic loading, and (iii) relatively uniform stress variation of principal stress components (Equation presented). along with depth. Eaton's extended model could not capture the stress layering effect precisely and may introduce more uncertainty because of its dependency on several unpredictable parameters while the proposed rheology model relies upon laboratory constituent parameters (B, n) where B is the inverse of static Young's modulus E and n describes time dependency of rock deformation under a given stress.",,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690314/1/Mandal-et-al_2022_ViscoelasticStressRelaxationForEstimatingShmin%20%20%281%29.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690314/Mandal-et-al_2022_ViscoelasticStressRelaxationForEstimatingShmin%20%20%281%29.pdf.txt,2023-03-13T11:30:09

Although 180° magnetization switching is vital to spintronic devices, the achievement of 180° magnetization switching via magnetoelectric coupling is still a fundamental challenge. Herein, voltage-driven full resistance switching of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) with dipole interaction on a ferroelectric substrate through switchable parallel/antiparallel magnetization alignment is demonstrated. Parallel magnetization alignment along the y direction is obtained under a bias magnetic field. By rotating the magnetic easy axis via strain-mediated magnetoelectric coupling, the parallel magnetizations in the MTJ reorient to the x axis with opposite paths because of dipole interaction, thus resulting in antiparallel alignment. Moreover, this voltage switching of MTJs is nonvolatile owing to variations in dipole interaction and can be well understood via phase field simulations. The results provide an avenue to realize electrical switching of MTJs and are significant for exploring energy-efficient spintronic devices.",,Published,,,2023-03-13T11:10:10

EVs are marching strongly into a market that is currently dominated by internal combustion engine vehicles, the current main fuel of which is a known contributor to most of the emission related climate problems that we now find ourselves in. Moving ahead, it is important that any move from internal combustion engines to more nascent technologies like EVs is sustainable and not detrimental to the environment. There is an ongoing debate between proponents of so-called e-fuels (being synthetic fuels made from atmospheric carbon dioxide, water, and renewable energy) and EVs wherein e-fuels are largely accused of being a half-measure while EVs are thought to contribute more in terms of brake and tire emissions than the ICE vehicles. This raises the question of whether there should even be a complete replacement of the combustion engine vehicle fleet or that should there be a 'mobility mix' similar to how we currently refer to an energy mix with power grids.

The complexity of the ecosystem and the traditionally siloed approach within the Industry has often prevented the adoption of a holistic approach to addressing the fundamental problem of energy, which is the ultimate constraint to any complex deployment. The proposed framework facilitates an assessment of bottlenecks and their implication on the network: it may be used by both academic and industry stakeholders to develop solutions that address the real issues and enable a healthy ecosystem. After a comprehensive survey of the ecosystem and its challenges, the following key areas were selected for a more in-depth analysis: •Network Efficiency •Small Cell Migration •Base Station Power •Economic Factors •Grid/Utility This Chapter also identifies the need for a comprehensive “Systems-of-Systems” (SoS) analysis to address the complex inter-relations among the multiple layers, which the infrastructure leverages. An initial proposal describes how a model can be built to enable a comprehensive assessment of energy requirements across such a diverse ecosystem.

Accordingly, the process includes comprehensive dimensional analysis, detailed design, and building a desired experimental flow loop setup. A unique mechanical design allows pipe rotation while achieving a closed-loop system. A clamp-on tool assists in agitating the cuttings to reduce accumulation at the bottom of the borehole. Experimental performance with various cuttings compares scenarios with and without pipe rotation. Among the key factors influencing cuttings transport in horizontal wells are drill pipe rotation (RPM), flow rate (Q), mud rheology, cuttings size, flow regime, and penetration rate (ROP). This research focuses on the mechanical removal of solid cuttings. Experimental work emphasizes cuttings' behavior showing different patterns for their movement in deviated wells by utilizing image processing. Drillstring rotation proves to be a crucial factor for efficient hole cleaning. The specific shape and dimensions of the clamp- on tool affect the efficiency of the hole cleaning process and impact the distance covered by the agitated cuttings downstream of the tool. The concept of the tool depends on blades that agitate cuttings as it rotates. Optimum tool design considers the physical properties of the fluid and the cuttings. The results show that as the tool agitates cuttings and moves them into the higher velocity region, the cuttings advance with the flow, which improves cuttings transport and reduces bedding formation. Assuming low flow rates, tool application increased average particle velocity within the tool more than four times (372%) and twice after the tool. In addition, differential pressure (Δp) shows a significant decrease while the tool operates, indicating improvement in hole cleaning. Lab-scaled flow loop development aims to simulate drilling conditions with drillpipe rotation and different downhole clamp-on tool geometries. The results show different flow patterns from experimental observations of liquid-particles flow in the horizontal wellbore, assisted by the proposed downhole clamp- on tool. The innovative tool design is a promising step in reducing hole cleaning issues with mechanical- assisted tools.",,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690254/1/SPE-213675-MS_Manuscript_Jelena%20Skenderija.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690254/SPE-213675-MS_Manuscript_Jelena%20Skenderija.pdf.txt,2023-03-12T11:30:11

Acoustophoresis is a promising technique where acoustic direct radiation forces can aid to demulsify O/W emulsions and enhance oil separation of the produced water stream. Herein, we explored the coalescence behavior of oil-in-water emulsion in a stationary acoustophoretic setup. To quantify the acoustic O/W separation efficiency and identify the proper acoustic parameters for various O/W emulsion compositions, a series of experiments were conducted in large-scale (4-in × 4in × 12-in) acoustic resonator using O/W emulsions of different compositions. The separation efficiency is assessed by comparing the oil layer thickness of an emulsion separated by gravity alone with that separated after being subjected to the standing wave field. The mixing time and speed was 15 minutes and 2000 rpm respectively which was optimized experimentally for stable emulsion. Rushton impeller was used for high turbulence mixing. Results demonstrated the importance of optimizing the acoustic parameters (frequency, power) with respect to the emulsion droplet size distribution for improving the separation efficiency. The formation of bands and the accelerated separation of oil droplets are facilitated by the application of sufficient energy to the proper standing wave. This study showed that when ultrasonic was applied to the emulsion under limited frequency and power, coalescence was shown on the surface, meaning in a standing wave field, oil droplets aggregate and collide in the anti-nodal planes, where their coalescence and buoyancy occur when direct radiation force (Aggregating oil droplet), and secondary acoustic force (when coalescence takes place due to the causing of attractive or repulsive forces), therefore separation will happen. Results showed that the oil layer thickness recovered from the O/W emulsion subjected to the acoustic field was ~70% higher than that of gravitational separation alone. Results also showed that deviating from the standing wave frequency or delivering excessive acoustic power can result in random droplet motion, secondary emulsification, and a decrease in separation efficiency. An observation experiment was done using stable emulsions with droplet sizes ranging from 50 to 100 micron subjected at ultrasonic radiation with varying amount of acoustic power starting with small amount of powerand increased gradually until reach the maximum power; 111 to 280 watts, showedemulsion separation is progressing with maximum efficiency or standing wave is creating the maximum capacity for an emulsion dispersed content. This regime of system depends critically on the oil content of an emulsion. Also, computational work has been conducted using COMSOL Multiphysics for illustration of frequency influence on oil separation. This work provides novel information to direct the field implementation of in-line acoustic oil-water separation tool by identifying the key parameters that influence oil coalescence hence the separation efficiency of the tool.",,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690253/1/Manuscript%20Draft__SPE-213344-MS%20Final_Version3%20%281%29.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690253/Manuscript%20Draft__SPE-213344-MS%20Final_Version3%20%281%29.pdf.txt,2023-03-13T17:00:05

As we know, the human body is a lossy channel that significantly attenuates the propagation of electromagnetic waves (EMW). Therefore, channel models are critical in evaluating the communication link. One of the most predominant models is the path loss channel model, which is used to cover a wide range of communication channels and frequency bands in WBAN. This paper investigates the EMW in a human model irradiated by an incident electromagnetic plane wave. A planar multilayer structure is used for modeling human tissue. Moreover, the steady-state electromagnetic distribution is calculated by solving the differential and integral equations (DIE) by using the method of moments (MoM). The obtained results demonstrate the great use of performing a theoretical analysis for path loss (PL) and power loss density (PLD) estimation. The magnitude of the electric field inside muscle tissue at various depths, and with the most important frequencies in medical applications, is evaluated. This investigation provides evidence that the penetration of EMW in biological tissue strongly depends on the frequency and thickness of the tissue involved. Thus, for different examined conditions, an excellent agreement between recent results that were obtained by an analytical method, finite element (FEM), and the proposed MoM method is verified to be valid in this investigation, and it is found that the distribution of the field, PL, and PLD for different communication scenarios is very promising to determine the quality of communication for WBAN technology.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690252/1/electronics-12-01282.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690252/electronics-12-01282.pdf.txt,2023-03-12T11:10:12

Given the consistent increases in desertification around the world, which are associated with increasing salinity, high temperature, and water scarcity, the survival of halophytes due to their secondary metabolic contents has prioritized these plant species, which have now become increasingly important for environmental protection, land reclamation, and food and animal-feed security, with their primary utility in traditional societies as sources of drugs. On the medicinal herbs front, because the fight against cancer is still ongoing, there is an urgent need for development of more efficient, safe, and novel chemotherapeutic agents, than those currently available. The current review describes these plants and their secondary-metabolite-based chemical products as promising candidates for developing newer cancer therapeutics. It further discusses the prophylactic roles of these plants, and their constituents in prevention and management of cancers, through an exploration of their phytochemical and pharmacological properties, with a view on immunomodulation.

The mergence of nanoimprinting and holography is one of the fascinating study areas for image display and information masking in meta-devices. However, existing methods rely on layering and enclosing, where many resonators combine various functions effectively at the expense of efficiency, design complication, and complex fabrication. To overcome these limitations, a novel technique for a tri-operational metasurface has been suggested by merging PB phase-based helicity-multiplexing and Malus's law of intensity modulation. To the best of our knowledge, this technique resolves the extreme-mapping issue in a single-sized scheme without increasing the complexity of the nanostructures. For proof of concept, a multi-functional metasurface built of single-sized zinc sulfide (ZnS) nanobricks is developed to demonstrate the viability of simultaneous control of near and far-field operations. The proposed metasurface successfully verifies the implementation of a multi-functional design strategy with conventional single-resonator geometry by reproducing two high-fidelity images in the far field and projecting one nanoimprinting image in the near field.

In particular, the pre-chamber combustion concept has the potential to further extend the lean-burn limit. To pursue a sustainable mode of the powertrain in future transportation, this work intended to investigate the hydrogen pre-chamber combustion concept on a heavy-duty diesel metal engine under lean-burn conditions. By using the CFD modeling method, the pathway to achieving higher engine efficiency along with lower NOx emissions were explored. The results demonstrated that the lean-burn passive pre-chamber combustion effectively restrained the heat release process within the pre-chamber and yielded negligible NOx emissions while degrading complete combustion and combustion stability as a trade-off. To extend the engine operating range, an adequate amount of fuel was introduced into the pre-chamber. Compared to methane, the active pre-chamber combustion of hydrogen exhibited a significantly higher tendency to induce end-gas autoignition owing to its faster heat release within the pre-chamber. The pressure rise rate within the pre-chamber was successfully controlled by adjusting the pre-chamber throat diameter. Higher thermal efficiency was achieved with an increased compression ratio at the same spark ignition timing because of the advanced combustion phasing. However, the operating range was narrowed for the limit of end-gas autoignition and high pressure rise rate.",,Published,,,2023-03-12T10:20:09

TPO oxidation and pyrolysis were conducted using air and N2, respectively, at three different heating rates (5, 10, and 20 °C/min) in a temperature range between 30 and 700 °C. Along the temperature program, the evolved gases were directed to the FTIR cell, where the functional groups within species present were measured. A global kinetic analysis was performed for the TPO oxidation, using four isoconversional methods, as well as the distributed activation energy model (DAEM) developed by Miura and Maki. The results obtained suggest that the oxidation process of TPO can be divided into three different reaction stages, namely: low-temperature oxidation (LTO) (<400 °C), fuel decomposition (400–500 °C), and high-temperature oxidation (HTO) (500–700 °C). Within the LTO stage, oxygen addition reaction to produce hydroperoxides were considered dominant in the initial stages, while the decomposition of the formed hydroperoxides was more significant at the later stage. Due to the characteristics of TPO, e.g., the presence of highly volatile compounds, the evaporation of hydrocarbons played an important role within the LTO stage. In the fuel decomposition stage, the formation of coke by the oxidative cracking of LTO residue and oxygen addition were believed to be the main reactions leading to gaseous products such as CO, CO2, H2O. Finally, in the HTO stage, the oxidation of coke was considered as the main reaction, exhibiting an evident exothermic activity. The activation energy distribution shows a similar pattern among the isoconversional methods and DAEM, with fluctuations between 40 and 200 kJ/mol. The analysis presented in this work sheds new light on the thermal decomposition of oil derived from the pyrolysis of ELT, which is relevant for its use in combustion systems.",,Published,,,2023-03-12T10:10:09

Therefore, characterization of carbonate rocks using petrophysical data is a challenging task. Conventional neutron, sonic, and neutron-density porosities are proven to be less accurate as compared to the NMR porosity. This study aims to predict the NMR porosity by implementing three different machine learning (ML) algorithms using conventional well logs including neutron-porosity, sonic, resistivity, gamma ray, and photoelectric factor. Data, comprising 3500 data points, was acquired from a vast carbonate petroleum reservoir in the Middle East. The input parameters were selected based on their relative importance with respect to output parameter. Three ML techniques such as adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), artificial neural network (ANN), and functional network (FN) were implemented for the development of prediction models. The model's accuracy was evaluated by correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), and average absolute percentage error (AAPE). The results demonstrated that all three prediction models are reliable and consistent exhibiting low errors and high 'R' values for both training and testing prediction when related to actual dataset. However, the performance of ANN model was better as compared to other two studied ML techniques based on minimum AAPE and RMSE errors (5.12 and 0.39) and highest R (0.95) for testing and validation outcome. The AAPE and RMSE for the testing and validation results were found to be 5.38 and 0.41 for ANFIS and 6.06 and 0.48 for FN model, respectively. The ANFIS and FN models exhibited 'R' 0.937 and 0.942, for testing and validation dataset, respectively.

To facilitate data exchange among equipment within these substations, the IEC 61850 standard has become the predominant standard. However, this standardization has inadvertently made these substations more susceptible to cyberattacks, which is a significant concern given the confidential information that is transmitted. As a result, cybersecurity in substations is becoming an increasingly critical topic. IEC 62351 standard provides guidelines and considerations for securing the IEC 61850 messages to mitigate their vulnerabilities. While securing Generic Object-Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) messages has received considerable attention in literature, the same level of scrutiny has not been applied to Sampled Value (SV) messages despite their susceptibility to cyberattacks and similar frame format. This paper presents the impact of replay and masquerade attacks on SV messages. It also develops a scheme for securing SV messages against these attacks.

Comparatively, these oxides have found limited applications in solar-to-hydrogen photocatalysis primarily due to their high electronegativity, which impedes electron transfer for converting protons into molecular hydrogen. We have shown recently that inserting s-block metal cations into p-block oxides is effective at lowering electronegativities while affording further control of band gaps. Here, we explain the origins of this dual tunability by demonstrating the mediator role of s-block metal cations in modulating orbital hybridization while not contributing to frontier electronic states. From this result, we carry out a comprehensive computational study of 109 ternary oxides of s- and p-block metal elements as candidate photocatalysts for solar hydrogen generation. We downselect the most desirable materials using band gaps and band edges obtained from Hubbard-corrected density-functional theory with Hubbard parameters computed entirely from first principles, evaluate the stability of these oxides in aqueous conditions, and characterize experimentally four of the remaining materials, synthesized with high phase uniformity, to assess the accuracy of computational predictions. We thus propose seven oxide semiconductors, including CsIn3O5, Sr2In2O5, and KSbO2 which, to the extent of our literature review, have not been previously considered as water-splitting photocatalysts.",,"Under Review",https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690224/1/2303.03332.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690224/2303.03332.pdf.txt,2023-03-09T16:00:09

This way, the regenerative braking system of the truck can completely recharge the truck’s battery. This paper investigates scenarios where electric trucks could operate indefinitely without grid electricity to charge their batteries. This concept was named perpetual motion electric truck (PMET).

We evaluate the reliability of multi-hop routing by introducing interruption probability, which is the probability that no relay device (ground gateway or satellite) is available during a hop. The single-hop interruption probability is derived and extended to the multi-hop interruption probability using a stochastic geometry-based approach. Since the interruption probability in HSTRN highly depends on the priority of selecting communication devices at different tiers, we propose three priority strategies: (i) stationary optimal priority strategy, (ii) single-hop interruption probability inspired strategy, and (iii) density inspired strategy. Among them, the interruption probability under the stationary optimal priority strategy can approach the ideal lower bound. However, when analyzing an HSTRN with a large number of tiers, the stationary optimal priority strategy is computationally expensive. The single-hop interruption probability inspired strategy is expected to be a low-complexity but less reliable alternative to the stationary optimal priority strategy. In numerical results, we study the complementarity between terrestrial devices and satellites. Furthermore, analytical results for reliability are also applicable to the analysis of satellite availability, coverage probability, and ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) rate.

This study implemented the feed-forward neural network to model the wettability behavior in a ternary system of rock minerals (quartz and mica), CO2, and brine under different operating conditions. To gain higher accuracy of the machine learning models, a sufficient dataset was utilized that was recorded by conducting a large number of laboratory experiments under a realistic pressure range, 0 – 25 MPa and the temperatures range, 298 – 343 K. The mica substrates were used as a proxy for the caprock, and quartz substrates were used a proxy for the reservoir rock. Different graphical exploratory data analysis techniques, such as heatmaps, violin plots, and pairplots were used to analyze the experimental dataset. To improve the generalization capabilities of the machine learning models k-fold cross-validation method, and grid search optimization approaches were implemented. The machine learning models were trained to predict the receding and advancing contact angles of mineral/CO2/brine systems. Both statistical evaluation and graphical analyses were performed to show the reliability and performance of the developed models. The results showed that the implemented ML model accurately predicted the wettability behavior under various operating conditions. The training and testing average absolute percent relative errors (AAPE) and R2 of the FFNN model for mica and quartz were 0.981 and 0.972, respectively. The results confirm the accuracy performance of the ML algorithms. Finally, the investigation of feature importance indicated that pressure had the utmost influence on the contact angles of the minerals/CO2/brine system. The geological conditions profoundly affect rock minerals wetting characteristics, thus CO2 geo-storage capacities. The literature severely lacks advanced information and new methods for characterizing the wettability of mineral/CO2/brine systems at geo-storage conditions.

It is therefore essential to identify novel anti-TB drug candidates and target proteins to treat MDR-TB. Here, in vitro and in silico studies were used to investigate the anti-TB potential of two newly sourced actinomycins, actinomycin-X2 (act-X2) and actinomycin-D (act-D), from the Streptomyces smyrnaeus strain UKAQ_23 (isolated from the Jubail industrial city of Saudi Arabia). Methods: The anti-TB activity of the isolated actinomycins was assessed in vitro using the Mtb H37Ra, Mycobacterium bovis (BCG), and Mtb H37Rv bacterial strains, using the Microplate Alamar Blue Assay (MABA) method. In silico molecular docking studies were conducted using sixteen anti-TB drug target proteins using the AutoDock Vina 1.1.2 tool. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for both actinomycins were then performed with the most suitable target proteins, using the GROningen MAchine For Chemical Simulations (GROMACS) simulation software (GROMACS 2020.4), with the Chemistry at HARvard Macromolecular Mechanics 36m (CHARMM36m) forcefield for proteins and the CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF) for ligands. Results: In vitro results for the Mtb H37Ra, BCG, and Mtb H37Rv strains showed that act-X2 had minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 1.56 ± 0.0, 1.56 ± 0.0, and 2.64 ± 0.07 µg/mL and act-D had MIC values of 1.56 ± 0.0, 1.56 ± 0.0, and 1.80 ± 0.24 µg/mL respectively. The in silico molecular docking results showed that protein kinase PknB was the preferred target for both actinomycins, while KasA and pantothenate synthetase were the least preferred targets for act-X2and act-D respectively. The molecular dynamics (MD) results demonstrated that act-X2 and act-D remained stable inside the binding region of PknB throughout the simulation period. The MM/GBSA (Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area) binding energy calculations showed that act-X2 was more potent than act-D. Conclusion: In conclusion, our results suggest that both actinomycins X2 and D are highly potent anti-TB drug candidates. We show that act-X2is better able to antagonistically interact with the protein kinase PknB target than act-D, and thus has more potential as a new anti-TB drug candidate.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690211/1/peerj-14502.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690211/peerj-14502.pdf.txt,2023-03-09T12:00:10

The successful implementation of GCS requires a comprehensive risk assessment of the confinement of plumes and storage potential at each storage site. To better understand the integrity of the caprock after injecting CO2, it is necessary to develop robust and fast tools to evaluate the safe CO2 injection duration. This study applied deep learning (DL) techniques, such as fully connected neural networks, to predict the safe injection duration. A physics-based numerical reservoir simulator was used to simulate the movement of CO2 for 170 years following a 30-year CO2 injection period into a deep saline aquifer. The uncertainty variables were utilized, including petrophysical properties such as porosity and permeability, reservoir physical parameters such as temperature, salinity, thickness, and operational decision parameters such as injection rate and perforation depth. As mentioned earlier, the reservoir model was sampled using the Latin-Hypercube sampling approach to account for a wide range of parameters. Seven hundred twenty-two reservoir simulations were performed to create training, testing, and validation datasets. The DNN model was trained, and several executions were performed to arrive at the best model. After multiple realizations and function evaluations, the predicted results revealed that the three-layer FCNN model with thirty neurons in each layer could predict the safe injection duration of CO2 into deep saline formations. The DNN model showed an excellent prediction efficiency with the highest coefficient of determination factor of above 0.98 and AAPE of less than 1%. Also, the trained predictive models showed excellent agreement between the simulated ground truth and predicted trapping index, yet 300 times more computationally efficient than the latter. These findings indicate that the DNN-based model can support the numerical simulation as an alternative to a robust predictive tool for estimating the performance of CO2 in the subsurface and help monitor the storage potential at each part of the GCS project.",,Published,,,2023-03-09T11:30:08

The numerical reservoir simulation models are an excellent source for evaluating the likelihood and comprehending the physics underlying behind the interaction of CO2 and brine in subsurface formations. For various reasons, including the rock's highly fractured and heterogeneous nature, the rapid spread of the CO2 plume in the fractured network, and the high capillary contrast between matrix and fractures, simulating fluid flow behavior in NFR reservoirs during CO2 injection is computationally expensive and cumbersome. This paper presents a deep-learning approach to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics of CO2 saturation plumes during the injection and monitoring periods of Geological Carbon Sequestration (GCS) sequestration in NFRs. To achieve our purpose, we have first built a base case physics-based numerical simulation model to simulate the process of CO2 injection in naturally fractured deep saline aquifers. A standalone package was coded to couple the discrete fracture network in a fully compositional numerical simulation model. Then the base case reservoir model was sampled using the Latin-Hypercube approach to account for a wide range of petrophysical, geological, reservoir, and decision parameters. These samples generated a massive physics-informed database of around 900 cases that provides a sufficient training dataset for the DL model. The performance of the DL model was improved by applying multiple filters, including the Median, Sato, Hessian, Sobel, and Meijering filters. The average absolute percentage error (AAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), Structural similarity index metric (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and coefficient of determination (R2) were used as error metrics to examine the performance of the surrogate DL models. The developed workflow showed superior performance by giving AAPE less than 5% and R2 more than 0.94 between ground truth and predicted values. The proposed DL-based surrogate model can be used as a quick assessment tool to evaluate the long-term feasibility of CO2 movement in a fracture carbonate medium.",,Published,,,2023-03-09T11:20:08

However, accurate detection of CO2 leakage locations from underground traps remains a challenging problem. This study proposes a workflow that combines Bayesian inversion and deep learning algorithms to detect the sites of CO2 leakage. There are four main steps in the workflow. Step 1: we identify the key uncertainty parameters. Here we mean the CO2 leakage location. Then we get the training set using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) method and perform the high-fidelity simulation using CMG. Step 2: we train the surrogate model using the data set collected from the last step, in which the Bayesian optimization is used to tune the hyperparameters automatically. Step 3: we perform the Bayesian inversion to invert the CO2 leakage location, in which the surrogate serves as the forward model to reduce the computational expense. Step 4: we feed the inverted CO2 leakage location into the high-fidelity model to produce the pressure response. If the error between the pressure response between the surrogate and the high-fidelity model is small enough, the solution is accepted. Otherwise, the accuracy of the surrogate model and the convergence of the Bayesian inversion process are revisited. We validate this method using a synthetic model of CO2 injection. Results show that the proposed Bayesian inversion assisted by the deep learning algorithm can accurately detect the CO2 leakage location with narrow uncertainties.

Day 1 Sun, February 19, 2023. https://doi.org/10.2118/213450-ms","The improved oil recovery techniques, such as customized ionic composition waterflood or ""smart-water"" flood, are being developed to increment crude oil production. Counter-current spontaneous imbibition of brine into oil-saturated rock is a critical mechanism of recovery of the crude oil bypassed in highly-heterogeneous carbonate rocks. In laboratory, spontaneous imbibition in the Amott cell experiment is the main instrument to explore oil recovery from oil-saturated core plugs at different wettability conditions. The classical Amott test, however, masks a number of flaws that hinder interpretation of the physical phenomena in recovery dynamics and precise modeling of the cumulative recovery profiles. In this work, we identify these flaws in the spontaneous imbibition experiments with mixed-wet limestone samples saturated with crude oil. We describe an improved Amott method and study crude oil recovery from mixed-wet carbonate core plugs. The introduced modifications of the Amott test ensure reliable and reproducible results for both non-wetting mineral and crude oils. Finally, we show that the resulted smooth recovery profiles of oil production can be described with a mathematical model with high accuracy. For the first time, we show that generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution can be applied to model cumulative oil production from mixed-wet carbonate core samples.",,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690207/1/SPE-213450-MS_Manuscript.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690207/SPE-213450-MS_Manuscript.pdf.txt,2023-03-09T10:50:06

Day 1 Sun, February 19, 2023. https://doi.org/10.2118/213699-ms","Objective/Scope: Every year the petroleum industry spends more than an estimated $6 billion in mitigating wellbore instabilities that account for nearly half of the drilling-related NPT (non-productive time). Researchers believe wellbore instability problems occur primarily due to physical and chemical interactions between rocks and drilling fluid and mostly neglect the impact of drill string vibrations on wellbore stability. However, such vibrations can cause significant damage to the formation, which then degrades the formation's mechanical integrity and compound wellbore instabilities. An appreciable body of evidence exists documenting that higher RPM (revolutions per minute), higher WOB (weight on bit), and pendulum BHA (bottom hole assembly) can cause enhanced agitation of the wellbore wall rock which may result in formation damage – often accompanied with an increased ROP (rate of penetration). The primary objective of this work is to review the state of modelling vibrations as documented in the literature and then advance the development and impact of vibrations and rock failure due to the aforementioned drilling parameters using numerical methods. Methods, Procedures, Process: The proposed research will analyze the complex dynamic interaction between drill-string and borehole using a commercially available finite element package (e.g., COMSOL or ABAQUS etc.). These packages have the capability to create multiphysics-based models and simulate engineering and industry applications. A drill-string borehole assembly will be modelled with geometric and associated environmental and material boundary conditions (e.g., stress state, pore-fluid pressure, mud pressure etc.). The results will then be calibrated with experimental and field data. Results, Observations, Conclusions: Subsurface drilling parameters are often undetermined or not measurable during drilling. The proposed model will aim at developing a drill-string-dynamics model to simulate the interactions between the wellbore and the drill string. This includes (i) estimation of drill string vibrations for different drill string and BHA designs, (ii) the resulting impact forces from drill string vibrations for different wellbore designs, and (iii) the influence of the estimated impact forces on the wellbore wall of particular (chosen) rock types at its current stress or yielding state. Novel/Additive information: The research project proposed herein will equip the well-planning engineers with advanced and robust tools to predict and mitigate wellbore instabilities resulting from drill-string vibrations. We develop new models that incorporate the dynamics mentioned above in order to evaluate quantitatively the effects of drill string vibrations on wellbore instabilities. We anticipate contributions along the following themes: Improved predictive capability of wellbore instabilities for specific drill string and well designs, leading to minimal wellbore rock failure trends for different trajectories, lithology, geologic structure, mud weights (i.e., overbalances) and more. Establish recommendations for optimal drilling parameters (WOB, RPM, and ROP) for specific drill strings and well designs as a function of input parameter uncertainties and variabilities.",,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690205/1/SPE%20213699.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690205/SPE%20213699.pdf.txt,2023-03-09T10:20:11

To investigate the microscopic (pore-scale) phenomena, we present a fully coupled mathematical formulation of fluid flow and geomechanical deformation to model the fluid flow in fractured rocks. In this work, we employ a Darcy-Brinkman-Biot approach to describe the fully coupled flow and geomechanical processes in fractured rocks at the pore scale. Darcy-Brinkman-Stokes (DBS) model is used to model multi-scale flow in the fractured rocks, in which fracture flow is described by Navier-Stokes equations and flow in the surrounding matrix is modeled by Darcy's law. With this approach, a unified conservation equation for flow in both media (fracture and matrix) is applied. We then apply Biot's poroelasticity theory and Terzaghi's effective stress theory to capture the geomechanical deformation. The continuity of the fluid pressure is imposed to connect the DBS equation and the stress-seepage equation. This coupled model is employed to determine the permeability within the microfracture. Numerical results show that this coupled approach can capture the permeability under the effects of solid deformation and multi-scale formation. We develop a fully coupled model to capture the pore-scale flow-geomechanically process in fractured rocks. To our knowledge, the fully coupled framework is developed and applied to characterize fracture permeability at the pore scale in fractured rocks for the first time.",,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690204/1/MEOS-DBB-HH.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690204/MEOS-DBB-HH.pdf.txt,2023-03-09T10:10:11

Mud motor condition evaluation can assist in preventing mud motor damage and increasing drilling efficiency. This paper aims to develop a monitoring system that combines field data, data analytics and physics-based modelling to evaluate mud motor condition and performance. The drilling monitoring system is a set of modelling and analysis tools that utilize actual drilling data, power section performance data and drillstring design to recreate the drilling process. An unprocessed drilling dataset is required to assess the drilling operations (rotating or sliding mode, rotating off-bottom, backreaming, connections) and reconstruct the borehole trajectory from the measured survey and duty cycle (rotating and sliding mode). Interaction of the BHA and the borehole generate side forces and bending moments along the length of the BHA that are evaluated at each depth increment during the drilling process. Generated power and efficiency of the mud motor are calculated and incorporated into the dynamic simulation. The case study investigates two motor runs in vertical and inclined sections. Dynamic modelling and extensive data analytics assist in visualizing and correlating the input and output variables during the drilling process. The continuous evaluation of the differential pressure on the motor is the primary parameter that is investigated. The motor condition is established with a continuous wear-off test while drilling and correlation matrices to indicate a constant motor state for 135 hours. The system accurately monitors the motor's operating efficiency, with the additional advantage that the mud motor and drill bit performance are differentiated. Precise adjustments of the drilling parameters for the optimum depth of cut positively impact motor efficiency. In addition, an interesting observation shows that accurate modelling of downhole and surface torque provides significant insights regarding bit state. The results demonstrate that with the current methodology decrease in drilling efficiency is detected and is associated with bit wear. The work enables the evaluation of the mud motor condition and performance by utilizing a monitoring system and actual drilling data. The drilling monitoring system is a modelling analysis tool that can provide continuous feedback to the drilling operators about the condition of the BHA. Hence, it enables a real-time optimization process to manage mud motor condition and enhance drilling efficiency.",,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690203/1/SPE%20Manuscript%20-%20Drilling%20Monitoring%20System_Mud%20Motor%20Condition%20And%20Performance%20Evaluation_SPE_publishing.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690203/SPE%20Manuscript%20-%20Drilling%20Monitoring%20System_Mud%20Motor%20Condition%20And%20Performance%20Evaluation_SPE_publishing.pdf.txt,2023-03-09T10:00:11

We demonstrate that the salt-cast devices present a 10-fold increase in transconductance and achieve at least one year-long stability, while the pristine devices degrade within four months of storage. The salt-added films show improved backbone planarity and greater charge delocalization, leading to higher electronic charge carrier mobility. These films show a distinctly porous morphology where the interconnectivity is affected by the salt type, responsible for OECT speed. The salt-based films display limited changes in morphology and show lower water uptake upon electrochemical doping, a possible reason for the improved device cycling stability.

They exhibit a vast diversity of structural forms to maximize photosynthesis of their dinoflagellate endosymbionts (Symbiodiniaceae), while simultaneously minimizing photodamage. The symbiosis takes place in the presence of dynamic gradients of light, temperature and chemical species that are affected by the interaction of incident irradiance and water flow with the coral colony. We developed a multiphysics modelling approach to simulate microscale spatial distribution of light, temperature and O2 in coral fragments with accurate morphology determined by 3D scanning techniques. Model results compared well with spatial measurements of light, O2 and temperature under similar flow and light conditions. The model enabled us to infer the effect of coral morphology and light scattering in tissue and skeleton on the internal light environment experienced by the endosymbionts, as well as the combined contribution of light, water flow and ciliary movement on O2 and temperature distributions in the coral. The multiphysics modeling approach is general enough to enable simulation of external and internal light, O2 and temperature microenvironments in 3D scanned coral species with varying degrees of branching and morphology under different environmental conditions.

To do this, we evaluate current CL methods with respect to their computational costs. We hypothesize that under this new evaluation paradigm, computationally demanding CL approaches may perform poorly on streams with a varying distribution. We conduct extensive experiments on CLOC, a large-scale dataset containing 39 million time-stamped images with geolocation labels. We show that a simple baseline outperforms state-of-the-art CL methods under this evaluation, questioning the applicability of existing methods in realistic settings. In addition, we explore various CL components commonly used in the literature, including memory sampling strategies and regularization approaches. We find that all considered methods fail to be competitive against our simple baseline.

However, a non-negligible amount of population is concerned that such network densification will generate a notable increase in exposure to electric and magnetic fields (EMF) over the territory. In this paper, we analyze the downlink, uplink, and joint downlink&uplink exposure induced by the radiation from BSs and personal user equipment (UE), respectively, in terms of the received power density and exposure index. In our analysis, we consider the EMF restrictions set by the regulatory authorities such as the minimum distance between restricted areas (e.g., schools and hospitals) and BSs, and the maximum permitted exposure. Exploiting tools from stochastic geometry, mathematical expressions for the coverage probability and statistical EMF exposure are derived and validated. Tuning the system parameters such as the BS density and the minimum distance from a BS to restricted areas, we show a trade-off between reducing the population's exposure to EMF and enhancing the network coverage performance. Then, we formulate optimization problems to maximize the performance of the EMF-aware cellular network while ensuring that the EMF exposure complies with the standard regulation limits with high probability. For instance, the exposure from BSs is two orders of magnitude less than the maximum permissible level when the density of BSs is less than 20 BSs/km2.",,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690162/1/Joint_Uplink_and_Downlink_EMF_Exposure_Performance_Analysis_and_Design_Insights.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690162/Joint_Uplink_and_Downlink_EMF_Exposure_Performance_Analysis_and_Design_Insights.pdf.txt,2023-03-07T15:50:08

The reason for the presence of uncertainties is the lack of knowledge, inaccurate measurements, and inability to measure parameters at each spatial or time location. This problem is nonlinear and time-dependent. The solution is the salt mass fraction, which is uncertain and changes in time. Uncertainties in porosity, permeability, recharge, and mass fraction are modeled using random fields.

The two main approaches to recognize concepts in text are dictionary-based approaches and supervised machine learning approaches. While dictionary-based approaches fail in recognising new concepts and variations of existing concepts, supervised methods require sufficiently large annotated datasets which are expensive to obtain. Methods based on distant supervision have been developed to use machine learning without large annotated corpora. However, for biomedical concept recognition, these approaches do not yet exploit the context in which a concept occurs in literature, and they do not make use of prior knowledge about dependencies between concepts. Results: We developed BORD, a Biomedical Ontology-based method for concept Recognition using Distant supervision. BORD utilises context from corpora which are lexically annotated using labels and synonyms from the classes of a biomedical ontology for model training. Furthermore, BORD utilises the ontology hierarchy for normalising the recognised mentions to their concept identifiers. We show how our method improves the performance of state of the art methods for recognising disease and phenotype concepts in biomedical literature. Our method is generic, does not require manually annotated corpora, and is robust to identify mentions of ontology classes in text.

SSRN Electronic Journal. https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4354926","It is essential to research viscous characteristics due to the growing contribution that nanofluids play in heat transmission. For practical application, it is crucial to be aware of precise physical qualities. There is limited research on the modeling of viscosity that can provide precise predictions, despite the fact that viscosity is a significant characteristic of nanofluids. The goal of the current work is to use Response Surface Methodology to develop a prediction model for the viscosity of a nanofluid comprised of Titanium (TiO2) nanotubes dissolved in ethylene glycol and water. There are different mass concentrations of nanotubes, ranging from 0% to 1%, the shear rate was set to 150-500 s-1 and the temperature range was kept from 25-65°C. Additionally, utilizing the proposed model, a thorough optimization study was also carried out. The significance of process input parameters was assessed, and the findings showed that the nanofluid concentration is most significant input followed by temperature and shear rate. Two case studies were explored for both maximization and minimization of viscosity. The optimization results showed that the optimum condition, for viscosity maximization (0.00371 Pa.s), of input parameters such as nanofluid concentration, temperature and shear rate are 0.675%, 205 1/s, and 25°C for the maximum viscosity 0.00371 Pa.s. For viscosity minimization the optimum input parameters were nanofluid concentration, temperature and shear rate are 0.04%, 179 1/s, and 63.4°C respectively.",,"Under Review",https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690147/1/SSRN-id4354926.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690147/SSRN-id4354926.pdf.txt,2023-03-07T10:30:10

The approach in [16] establishes that when only having access to the time-discretized diffusion it is possible to remove the discretization bias with an estimator of finite variance. We improve on the method in [16] by introducing a modified estimator based on the recent work of [17]. We show that this new estimator is unbiased and has finite variance.

To accelerate distributed gradient descent, the popular strategy of local training is to communicate less frequently; that is, to perform several iterations of local computations between the communication steps. A recent breakthrough in this field was made by Mishchenko et al. (2022): their Scaffnew algorithm is the first to probably benefit from local training, with accelerated communication complexity. However, it was an open and challenging question to know whether the powerful mechanism behind Scaffnew would be compatible with partial participation, the desirable feature that not all clients need to participate to every round of the training process.

Here, we leverage genomics and the vast genetic diversity of sorghum – evolutionarily adapted to cope with Striga parasitism in Africa – to identify new Striga-resistant sorghum genotypes. We exploit a Striga resistance mechanism that hinges on essential communication molecules – strigolactones exuded by hosts to trigger parasite seed germination. We used the Sorghum Association Panel (SAP) to search for sorghum genotypes with a mutation on the LOW GERMINATION STIMULANT 1 ( LGS1) locus that makes them ineffective in inducing Striga germination.

Using the Monte Carlo method to approximate both integrals leads to a double-loop Monte Carlo estimator, which is often prohibitively expensive, as the estimation of the outer integral has bias relative to the variance of the inner integrand. For the case where the inner integrand is only approximately given, additional bias is added to the estimation of the outer integral. Variance reduction methods, such as importance sampling, have been used successfully to make computations more affordable. Furthermore, random samples can be replaced with deterministic low-discrepancy sequences, leading to quasi-Monte Carlo techniques. Randomizing the low-discrepancy sequences simplifies the error analysis of the proposed double-loop quasi-Monte Carlo estimator. To our knowledge, no comprehensive error analysis exists yet for truly nested randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimation (i.e., for estimators with low-discrepancy sequences for both estimations). We derive asymptotic error bounds and a method to obtain the optimal number of samples for both integral approximations.

Prior studies at atmospheric pressure showed Sd˜ to be enhanced significantly over SL at large negative κ due to flame-flame interactions. 1D simulations of an imploding cylindrical H2-air laminar premixed flame used to represent the local flame surfaces undergoing flame-flame interaction in a turbulent flame at the corresponding pressure conditions are performed to understand the interaction dynamics. These simulations emphasized the transient nature of the flame structure during flame-flame interactions and enabled analytical modeling of Sd˜ at these regions of extreme negative κ of the 3D DNS. The JPDF of Sd˜ and κ and the corresponding conditional averages from 3D DNS showed a negative correlation between Sd˜ and κ. The model successfully predicts the variation of ⟨Sd˜|κ⟩ with κ for the regions on the flame surface with κδL≪−1 at all pressures, with good accuracy. This shows the aforementioned configuration to be fruitful in representing local flame-flame interaction in 3D turbulent flames. Moreover, at κ=0, on average Sd˜ can deviate from SL, manifested by the internal flame structure, controlled by turbulence transport in the large Ka regime. Thus, the correlation of ⟨Sd˜⟩/SL with ⟨|∇cˆ|c0⟩ at κ=0 is explored.",,"Under Review",https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690128/1/2303.00911.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690128/2303.00911.pdf.txt,2023-03-06T16:10:07

Although extensive work has been made to assess the effect of oxygen on marine and freshwater biota, many studies did not capture the ecological importance of oxygen variations. Overlooking the fluctuating nature of oxygen may cause potential biases in the design and implementation of management policies of aquatic habitats. Conceptual perspectives on the dynamic nature of oxygen fluctuations have been raised in the scientific community to enhance the understanding of the effect of oxygen on the physiology and the ecology of aquatic species and the biogeochemical functioning of the ecosystems. A growing number of empirical works are outlining a novel conceptual framework that considers the magnitude of oxygen fluctuation as a key variable that explains adaptation to stress conditions. Oxygen in productive aquatic habitats shows large fluctuations at diel and seasonal scales, exposing aquatic species from conditions of extreme supersaturation to anoxia. Recent research indicates that such fluctuation tunes the physiological plasticity of the animal in response to thermal stresses. In this contribution, we provide compelling evidence based on current research that the fluctuating oxygen landscape, here defined as “oxyscape”, has an important role in aquatic animal physiology and adaptation and the ecosystem biogeochemistry.

This project will dramatically increase the seismic risk associated with active faults in the Gulf of Aqaba and the northern Red Sea. The Gulf of Aqaba, located between northern Saudi Arabia and the Sinai peninsula and formed by the transtension at the southern termination of the Dead Sea Transform, is a 180-km-long fault system that can generate earthquakes of magnitude at least 7.3 (as occurred in 1995). South of the gulf, the fault system connects to the Red Sea rift, where an earthquake of magnitude larger than 5 occurred in 2020. To investigate the regional tectonics and to better understand the associated seismic hazard, we have run a temporary network of 12 broadband seismic stations in the area since 2019. In this contribution, we present a new local magnitude scale calibrated by using more than 10,000 half-peak-to-peak amplitudes, automatically measured and Wood-Anderson-corrected, from earthquakes recorded by our network from May 2019 to February 2021. We used the amplitudes from the two horizontal components of each station to constrain the constants of the distance-dependent correction term of the local magnitude formula (n, related to the geometrical spreading, and k, related to the attenuation), magnitudes, and station corrections. We used a least-square regression scheme in two steps to ensure the convergence of the solution and independence of the results from the initial values. In the first step, we only inverted for n, k, and magnitudes. In the second step, we also inverted for station corrections and we used the magnitudes obtained in the first step as initial values for the second step. Conversely to most previous studies, we did not introduce any constraints on the station corrections. We run several regressions in a grid search approach to tackle the trade-off between n and k and find the best solution. We found that the estimated station corrections, because of the lack of constraints on them, are strongly correlated with the rock properties and topographic attributes. We also compared the frequency-magnitude distributions obtained with our best solution, including the station corrections (case A), the Hutton and Boore (1967) formula (case B), and Hutton and Boore formula with our station corrections (case C). We found that magnitudes for A are lower than for B and C. However, differences in statistical parameters, such as b-values, between A and C are neglectable. Our work provides NEOM with a reliable and locally calibrated earthquake magnitude scale. This new magnitude scale can also be applied in surrounding regions with similar geological features (e.g., Egypt, Jordan, and Israel). Moreover, this work highlights that estimations of station corrections are critical, and at least, as important as a locally calibrated magnitude scale.",,Published,,,2023-03-06T15:20:08

The part of the geoscientific community developing data-driven model has instead focused on predicting where landslides may occur via susceptibility models. Moreover, they have estimated when landslides may occur via models that belong to the early-warning-system or to the rainfall-threshold themes. In this context, few published researches have explored a joint spatio-temporal model structure. Furthermore, the third element completing the hazard definition, i.e., the landslide size (i.e., areas or volumes), has hardly ever been modeled over space and time. However, technological advancements in data-driven models have reached a level of maturity that allows to model all three components (Where, When and Size). This work takes this direction and proposes for the first time a solution to the assessment of landslide hazard in a given area by jointly modeling landslide occurrences and their associated areal density per mapping unit, in space and time. To achieve this, we used a spatio-temporal landslide database generated for the Nepalese region affected by the Gorkha earthquake. The model relies on a deep-learning architecture trained using an Ensemble Neural Network, where the landslide occurrences and densities are aggregated over a squared mapping unit of 1x1 km and classified/regressed against a nested 30~m lattice. At the nested level, we have expressed predisposing and triggering factors. As for the temporal units, we have used an approximately 6-month resolution. The results are promising as our model performs satisfactorily both in the susceptibility (AUC = 0.93) and density prediction (Pearson r = 0.93) tasks. This model takes a significant distance from the common susceptibility literature, proposing an integrated framework for hazard modeling in a data-driven context.

It is a non-parametric, iterative method for making probabilistic predictions by sampling from a set of particles, which are updated using gradient information of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the target posterior distribution and a user-defined proposal distribution. One of the main benefits of SVGD is its ability to handle complex, high-dimensional distributions. This is particularly useful in geophysics, where datasets can be large, and the subsurface model of interest is high-dimensional. However, the computational cost of SVGD increases with the number of particles used to characterize the posterior. Its performance also depends on the choice of the prior distribution, as it influences the SVGD ability to provide geophysical and geological realism in the posterior samples. There have been efforts to improve the efficiency of SVGD for large data sets, such as by introducing mini-batch techniques and deep learning-based prior aimed at producing high-resolution posterior samples. Along this direction, we are advancing the frontier of the SVGD algorithm by coupling it with the Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework, which allows sampling from a regularized target posterior distribution, where the target posterior distribution is regularized by a convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoiser. We showcase its ability to produce high-resolution, geologically trustworthy samples representative of the subsurface structures on a variety of geophysical problems for reservoir characterization and velocity model building (e.g., full waveform inversion).",,Published,,,2023-03-06T15:10:07

Sensitivity of African Easterly Waves to Dust Direct Radiative Forcing. https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-4000","African Easterly Waves (AEWs) are the most important precipitation-producing dynamic systems in tropical Africa and Atlantic, where dust in the atmosphere is abundant. But the past studies lack consensus on the sign and magnitude of the dust radiative forcing impact on AEWs primarily because of the disagreement in calculating dust solar radiation absorption. The incapability of coarse-resolution models to represent various dust-AEW interactions is another source of uncertainty. The present study uses a high-resolution atmospheric general circulation model, HiRAM, to investigate the sensitivity of AEWs to the dust direct radiative forcing when dust shortwave absorption varies within the observed limits. Global simulations are conducted with the 25 km grid spacing to adequately simulate AEWs and associated circulation features. Four 10-year experiments are conducted: One control experiment without dust and three others with dust assuming dust is an inefficient, standard, and very efficient shortwave absorber. The results show that AEWs are highly sensitive to dust shortwave absorption. As dust shortwave absorption increases, AEW activity intensifies and broadens the wave track shifting it southward. The 6-9 day waves are more sensitive to dust shortwave absorption than the 3-5 day waves, where the response in the former has a stark land-sea contrast. The sensitivity of AEW to dust solar radiation absorption arises from a combination of energy conversion mechanisms. Although baroclinic energy conversion dominates the energy cycle, the responses to dust shortwave heating in barotropic and generation terms are comparable to that in baroclinic conversion.",,Published,,,2023-03-06T15:00:08

However, recent environmental data applications suggest that asymptotic independence is equally important and, unfortunately, existing spatial models in this setting that are both flexible and can be fitted efficiently are scarce. Here, we propose a new spatial copula model based on the generalized hyperbolic distribution, which is a specific normal mean-variance mixture and is very popular in financial modeling. The tail properties of this distribution have been studied in the literature, but with contradictory results. It turns out that the proofs from the literature contain mistakes. We here give a corrected theoretical description of its tail dependence structure and then exploit the model to analyze a simulated dataset from the inverted Brown--Resnick process, hindcast significant wave height data in the North Sea, and wind gust data in the state of Oklahoma, USA.

We considered simultaneous injections of SO2, volcanic ash, and water vapor. We conducted multiple ensemble simulations with different injection configurations to test the evolution of SO2, SO4, ash masses, stratospheric aerosol optical depth, surface area density (SAD), and 24the stratospheric temperature response against available observations. We found that the volcanic cloud evolution is sensitive to the altitude where volcanic debris is initially injected and the initial concentrations of the eruption products that affect radiative heating and lofting of the volcanic cloud. The numerical experiments with the injection of 12 Mt SO2, 75 Mt of volcanic ash, and 150 Mt of water vapor at 20 km show the best agreement with the observation of aerosol optical depth and stratospheric temperature response. Volcanic water injected by eruptive jets and/or intruding through the tropopause accelerates SO2 oxidation. But the mass of volcanic water retained in the stratosphere is controlled by the stratospheric temperature at the injection level. For example, volcanic materials are released in the cold point above the tropical tropopause, and most of the injected water freezes and sediments as ice crystals. The water vapor directly injected into the volcanic cloud increases the SO2− mass and stratospheric aerosol optical depth by about 5%. The coarse 4ash comprises 98% of the ash injected mass. It sediments within a few days, but aged submicron ash could stay in the stratosphere for a few months providing SAD for heterogeneous chemistry. The presence of ash accelerates SO2 oxidation by 10%–20% due to heterogeneous chemistry, radiative heating, lofting, and faster dispersion of volcanic debris. Ash aging affects its lifetime and optical properties, almost doubling the radiative ash heating. The 2.5-year simulations show that the stratospheric temperature anomalies forced by radiative heating of volcanic debris in our experiments with the 20 km injection height agree well with observations and reanalysis data. This indicates that the model captures the long-term evolution and climate effect of the Pinatubo volcanic cloud. The volcanic cloud’s initial lofting, facilitated by ash particles’ radiative heating, controls the oxidation rate of SO2. Ash accelerates the formation of the sulfate layer in the first 2 months after the eruption. We also found that the interactive calculations of OH and heterogeneous chemistry increase the volcanic cloud sensitivity to water vapor and ash injections. All those factors must be accounted for in modeling the impact of large-scale volcanic injections on climate and stratospheric chemistry.",,Published,,,2023-03-06T15:00:08

However, there are safety issues associated with the operation of nuclear reactors. In particular, volatile radioactive elements, primarily 129I and 131I, in the form of molecular iodine (I2) or organic iodides (e.g., CH3I and CH3CH2I), are harmful for the environment and human health and must be removed before discharging the off-gas. Adsorption processes employing porous solid adsorbents to capture radioactive iodine compounds have attracted considerable attention owing to their simple operation and low maintenance cost and because they avoid the use of highly corrosive solutions. Despite the efforts devoted to developing novel adsorbents for iodine capture, certain critical issues related to practical applications have been overlooked. This review summarizes the adsorption mechanisms employed to capture I2 and CH3I, focusing on the different adsorbent requirements. This review also compares the static and dynamic evaluation systems, analyzes the structure–function relationship under different testing conditions, and highlights the importance of using appropriate conditions to evaluate adsorbents. Moreover, the simultaneous capture of I2 and CH3I is discussed, which is quite challenging but has been largely ignored in previous studies. Finally, this review outlines the challenges and opportunities in this field from the perspective of materials design and system evaluation, indicating that properly designing adsorbents to provide sufficient chemisorption sites may be the only way to meet the practical application requirements.",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690113/1/d2ta09448g.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690113/d2ta09448g.pdf.txt,2023-03-06T14:40:08

Portico. https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202210683","Semiconducting colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) represent an emerging class of thermoelectric materials for use in a wide range of future applications. CQDs combine solution processability at low temperatures with the potential for upscalable manufacturing via printing techniques. Moreover, due to their low dimensionality, CQDs exhibit quantum confinement and a high density of grain boundaries, which can be independently exploited to tune the Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity, respectively. This unique combination of attractive attributes makes CQDs very promising for application in emerging thermoelectric generator (TEG) technologies operating near room temperature. Herein, we review recent progress in CQDs for application in emerging thin-film thermoelectrics. We start by outlining the fundamental concepts of thermoelectricity in nanostructured materials, followed by an overview of the popular synthetic methods used to produce CQDs with controllable size and shape. Recent strides in CQD-based thermoelectrics are then discussed with particular emphasis on their application in thin-film TEGs. Finally, we highlight the current challenges and future perspectives in enhancing the performance of CQD-based thermoelectric materials for use in emerging applications.",,Published,,,2023-03-06T14:30:06

Shallow seafloor sediments experience extremely low effective stress, and consequently, these sediments exhibit very low in-situ density, shear wave velocity, and shear stiffness. We combined data extracted from the literature with new laboratory and field results to develop a comprehensive understanding of shallow seafloor sediments. First, we explored the sediment-dependent self-compaction characteristics starting with the asymptotic void ratio at the interface between the water column and the sediment column. The asymptotic void ratio depends on the particle size and shape in coarse-grained sediments and on mineralogy and pore fluid chemistry in fine-grained clayey sediments; overall, the asymptotic void ratio correlates with the sediment-specific surface and compressibility. Second, we developed a fork-type insertion probe to measure shear wave velocity profiles with depth. Detailed data analyses confirm the prevalent role of effective stress on shear wave velocity Vs=α(σ′m/kPa)β, and the inverse relationship between α and β parameters reveals that electrical interactions alter the velocity profile only in very high specific surface area sediments at very low effective stress and shows that ray bending affects the computed velocities only in the upper few centimeters (for the probe geometry used in this study). Probe insertion causes excess pore fluid pressure and effective stress changes; the ensuing time-dependent diffusion detected through shear wave velocity changes can be analyzed to estimate the coefficient of consolidation.

Extensive comparisons with scatterometer data suggested a direction-dependent wind calibration with a strong influence on the underestimation of offshore blowing winds. The dominant wave patterns in the basin are described together with the characteristics of the related winds.

In particular, reagent prediction for arbitrary reactions, a crucial aspect of condition recommendation, has been largely overlooked in cheminformatics until recently. Here we employ the Molecular Transformer, a state-of-the-art model for reaction prediction and single-step retrosynthesis, to tackle this problem. We train the model on the US patents dataset (USPTO) and test it on Reaxys to demonstrate its out-of-distribution generalization capabilities. Our reagent prediction model also improves the quality of product prediction: the Molecular Transformer is able to substitute the reagents in the noisy USPTO data with reagents that enable product prediction models to outperform those trained on plain USPTO.

Journal of Energy Storage, 62, 106921. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2023.106921","The geological sequestration of carbon dioxide, including mineralization in basaltic formations, has been identified as a promising method of attaining a low-carbon economy. However, successful CO2 storage depends on both the CO2 wettability of the basaltic rocks and the basalt rock-fluid interfacial interactions. The contact angles of brine/CO2 systems for Western Australian (WA) and Iceland basalts have been recently reported in the literature. However, contact angle datasets for evaluating the CO2 wettability of Saudi Arabian (SA) basalt have not been previously reported. Moreover, there is limited information on the impact of organic acids on the wettability of the basalt/CO2/brine system. In the present study, the contact angles of supercritical CO2/brine systems on SA basalt are measured at temperatures of 298 and 323 K, and at various pressures of 0.1–20 MPa in the absence and presence of organic acid (10−2 mol/L stearic acid). Various analytical methods are used to characterize the SA basalt surface, and the wetting behavior of the SA basalt is compared with that of the WA and Iceland basalts. The quantity of CO2 that can be safely trapped underneath the SA basalt (in terms of CO2 column height) is then computed from the experimental data. At the highest tested temperature and pressure (20 MPa and 323 K), the pure SA basalt is found to remain strongly water-wet, with advancing (θa) and receding (θr) contact angles of 46.7° and 43.2°, respectively, whereas the Iceland basalt becomes moderately water-wet (θa = 85.1° and θr=81.8°), and the WA basalt becomes CO2-wet (θa = 103.6° and θr=96.1°). However, the organic-aged SA basalt attains a CO2-wet state (θa = 106.8° and θr = 95.2°). In addition, the CO2 column height of the pure SA basalt is higher than that reported for the WA and Iceland basalts. Further, at 323 K, the CO2 column height decreases from 835 m at 5 MPa to −957 m at 20 MPa. These results suggest that there could be both freer plumb and lateral movement of CO2 into the SA basalt in the presence of organic acid, thus resulting in lower residual and mineral trapping capacities, and fewer eventual leakages of CO2, across the geological formation.",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690073/1/1-s2.0-S2352152X23003183-main.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690073/1-s2.0-S2352152X23003183-main.pdf.txt,2023-03-06T11:40:09

Corals across the Red Sea are subject to pronounced environmental differences, but studies so far suggest that animal populations are largely connected, excepting evidence for a genetic break between the northern-central and southern regions. Here, we investigated population structure and holobiont assemblage of two common pocilloporid corals, Pocillopora verrucosa and Stylophora pistillata, across the Red Sea. We found little evidence for population differentiation in P. verrucosa, except for the southernmost site. Conversely, S. pistillata exhibited a complex population structure with evidence for within-reef and regional genetic differentiation, in line with differences in their reproductive mode (P. verrucosa is a broadcast spawner and S. pistillata is a brooder). Analysis for genomic loci under positive selection identified 85 sites (18 of which were in coding sequences) that distinguished the southern P. verrucosa population from the remainder of the Red Sea population. By comparison, we found 128 loci (24 of which were residing in coding sequences) in S. pistillata with evidence for local adaptation at various sites. Functional annotation of the underlying proteins revealed putative roles in the response to stress, lipid metabolism, transport, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and ciliary function (among others). Microbial assemblages of both coral species showed pervasive association with microalgal symbionts from the genus Symbiodinium (former clade A) and bacteria from the genus Endozoicomonas that exhibited significant differences according to host genotype and environment. The disparity of population genetic and holobiont assemblage patterns even between closely related species (family Pocilloporidae) highlights the need for multispecies investigations to better understand the role of the environment in shaping evolutionary trajectories.

We sought to develop a standardized, quantitative survey method for cryptobenthic fishes that permits their sampling across a variety of habitats and conditions. Fish-specific autonomous reef monitoring structures (FARMS) are designed to sample cryptobenthic fishes using a suite of accessible and affordable materials. To generate a variety of microhabitats, FARMS consist of three layers of stacked PVC pipes in three different sizes, as well as a bottom and top level of loose PVC-pipe fragments in a mesh basket. We deployed FARMS across a variety of habitats, including coral reefs, seagrass beds, oyster reefs, mangroves, and soft-bottom habitats across six locations (Hawai'i, Texas, Panama, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and Curaçao). From shallow estuaries to coral reefs beyond 100 m depth, FARMS attracted distinct communities of native cryptobenthic fishes with strong site or habitat specificity. Comparing the FARMS to communities sampled with alternative methods (enclosed clove-oil stations on coral reefs in Panama and oyster sampling units on oyster reefs in Texas) suggests that FARMS yield a subset of cryptobenthic fish species that are representative of those present on local coral and oyster reefs. While FARMS yield fewer individuals per sample, they are efficient sampling devices relative to the sampled area. We demonstrate that FARMS represent a useful tool for standardized collections of cryptobenthic fishes. While natural substrata are bound to yield more mature communities with a larger number of individuals and wider range of specialist species, the potential to deploy and retrieve FARMS in turbid environments, beyond regular SCUBA depth, and where fish collections using anaesthetics or ichthyocides are forbidden suggests that they are a valuable complementary technique to survey fishes in aquatic ecosystems.

These laws have emerged spontaneously in either discrete or low-dimension continuum simulations without power-law or stochastic heterogeneity. We show that the same emergence can occur in 3-D continuum simulations with fault interactions and rate-and-state friction. Our model approximates a strike-slip fault system as three en echelon faults. Simulations show spatio-temporally clustered earthquake sequences exhibiting characteristic Gutenberg-Richter scaling as well as empirical inter-event time distribution. The Gutenberg-Richter scaling occurs only in partial ruptures that result from fault interactions. With fault interactions, partial ruptures emerge when seismogenic width W over characteristic nucleation length L∞ is larger than 16.24, but none occur without fault interaction.

The key to revealing the shale gas differential enrichment mechanism is to explore the thermal evolution characteristics during tectonic evolution. Therefore, taking the Luzhou and Changning blocks as an example, which have obvious differences in tectonic evolution, the organic geochemical conditions of Longmaxi shale were firstly compared with the test data. Then, the thermal evolution characteristics under the background differential tectonic uplift-erosion were recovered using basin modeling techniques. The results showed that the two blocks contain similar organic geochemical conditions of the Longmaxi shale. Moreover, the hydrocarbon generation condition in Luzhou Block is greater than that in the Changning Block. Influenced by the differential tectonic evolution, the study area experienced a complex burial history and the formation of multiple unconformities. As a result, the present burial depth of Longmaxi Formation in the Luzhou Block is significantly greater than that in the Changning Block. The thermal evolution history of Longmaxi shale in the study area could be divided into three stages, including a low-temperature stage from Caledonian to Hercynian, a middle-temperature stage from Hercynian to Indosinian, and a high-temperature stage from Yanshanian to Himalayan. In addition, it was found that the Himalayan period is the main stage resulting in the differential gas bearing property of Longmaxi shale in the southern Sichuan area. Under the differential structural modification, the peak time of hydrocarbon generation in the Luzhou Block occurred earlier and the conversion rate was slightly higher than that in the Changning Block.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690055/1/692-2422-2-PB.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690055/692-2422-2-PB.pdf.txt,2023-03-06T09:00:07

Existing local training methods aim to resolve the training obstacles by completely cutting off the backward path between modules and isolating their gradients. These methods prevent information exchange between modules and result in inferior performance. This work proposes a novel local training algorithm, BackLink, which introduces inter-module backward dependency and facilitates information to flow backward along with the network. To preserve the computational advantage of local training, BackLink restricts the error propagation length within the module. Extensive experiments performed in various deep convolutional neural networks demonstrate that our method consistently improves the classification performance of local training algorithms over other methods. For example, our method can surpass the conventional greedy local training method by 6.45% in accuracy in ResNet32 classifying CIFAR100 and recent work by 2.58% in ResNet110 classifying STL-10 with much lower complexity, respectively. Analysis of computational costs reveals that small overheads are incurred in GPU memory costs and runtime on multiple GPUs. Our method can lead up to a 79% reduction in memory cost and 52% in simulation runtime in ResNet110 compared to the standard BP. Therefore, our method could create new opportunities for improving training algorithms towards better efficiency for real-time learning applications.",,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/690008/1/Supervised_Local_Training_with_Backward_Links_for_Deep_Neural_Networks.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/690008/Supervised_Local_Training_with_Backward_Links_for_Deep_Neural_Networks.pdf.txt,2023-03-05T16:40:08

Frontiers in Microbiology, 14. https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1075071","Nucleoli are subcellular compartments where transcription and maturation of pre-ribosomal RNAs occur. While the transcription of ribosomal RNAs is common to all living cells, the presence and ultrastructure of nucleoli has been only documented in eukaryotes. Asgard-Archaea, the closest prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes, and their near relatives TACK-Archaea have homologs of nucleolar proteins and RNAs in their genome, but the cellular organization of both is largely unexplored. Here we provide ultrastructural and molecular evidence for the presence of putative nucleolus-like subcellular domains in the TACK crenarchaeon Saccharolobus solfataricus (formerly known as Sulfolobus solfataricus). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed consistent electron-dense fibro-granular compartments, also positive to the specific silver staining for nucleolar organizer regions (AgNOR). TEM also confirmed that ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is spatially distributed in non-random, clustered arrays underlying fine structures, as observed by ultrastructural in situ hybridization (UISH). To further explore these observations, proteomic sequencing of isolated bands from AgNOR-stained protein gels was conducted and compared against a compiled inventory of putative nucleolar homologs from the S. solfataricus P1 genome. Sequenced AgNOR-sensitive peptides encoded homologs of eukaryotic nucleoli proteins, enriched for nucleolus-related functions. Our results provide first evidence that subcellular domains of nucleolar-like nature are not exclusive to eukaryotes. Based on our data, we propose a model for a putative nucleolus in S. solfataricus. Whereas technical limitations and further aspects remain a matter for future functional studies, our data supports the origin of nucleoli within the common ancestor of Eukarya and TACK-Archaea, based on a two-domain tree of life.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/689998/1/fmicb-14-1075071.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/689998/fmicb-14-1075071.pdf.txt,2023-03-05T15:50:06

Particularly triplet–triplet annihilation induced photon energy up-conversion (TTA-UC) holds promise to enhance the performance of solar cell and photodetection technologies. Despite the progress noted, a correlation between the solid-state microstructure of photoactuating TTA-UC organic composites and their photophysical properties is missing. This lack of knowledge impedes the effective integration of functional TTA-UC interlayers as ancillary components in operating devices. We here investigate a solution-processed model green-to-blue TTA-UC binary composite. Solid-state films of a 9,10 diphenyl anthracene (DPA) blue-emitting activator blended with a (2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaethyl-porphyrinato) PtII (PtOEP) green-absorbing sensitizer are prepared with a range of compositions and examined by a set of complementary characterization techniques. Grazing incidence X-ray diffractometry (GIXRD) measurements identify three PtOEP composition regions wherein the DPA:PtOEP composite microstructure varies due to changes in the packing motifs of the DPA and PtOEP phases. In Region 1 (≤2 wt%) DPA is semicrystalline and PtOEP is amorphous, in Region 2 (between 2 and 10 wt%) both DPA and PtOEP phases are amorphous, and in Region 3 (≥10 wt%) DPA remains amorphous and PtOEP is semicrystalline. GIXRD further reveals the metastable DPA-β polymorph species as the dominant DPA phase in Region 1. Composition dependent UV-vis and FT-IR measurements identify physical PtOEP dimers, irrespective of the structural order in the PtOEP phase. Time-gated photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy imaging confirm the presence of PtOEP aggregates, even after dispersing DPA:PtOEP in amorphous poly(styrene). When arrested in Regions 1 and 2, DPA:PtOEP exhibits delayed PtOEP fluorescence at 580 nm that follows a power-law decay on the ns time scale. The origin of PtOEP delayed fluorescence is unraveled by temperature- and fluence-dependent PL experiments. Triplet PtOEP excitations undergo dispersive diffusion and enable TTA reactions that activate the first singlet-excited (S1) PtOEP state. The effect is reproduced when PtOEP is mixed with a poly(fluorene-2-octyl) (PFO) derivative. Transient absorption measurements on PFO:PtOEP films find that selective PtOEP photoexcitation activates the S1 of PFO within ∼100 fs through an up-converted 3(d, d*) PtII-centered state.",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/689995/1/d2sc06426j.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/689995/d2sc06426j.pdf.txt,2023-03-05T15:00:09

However, the germplasm resources currently available to facilitate quinoa expansion worldwide are restricted to a small portion of quinoa’s total genetic diversity, in part because of day-length sensitivity and issues related to seed sovereignty. This study aimed to characterize phenotypic relationships and variation within a quinoa world core collection. The 360 accessions were planted in a randomized complete block design with four replicates in each of two greenhouses in Pullman, WA during the summer of 2018. Phenological stages, plant height, and inflorescence characteristics were recorded. Seed yield, composition, thousand seed weight, nutritional composition, shape, size, and color were measured using a high-throughput phenotyping pipeline. Considerable variation existed among the germplasm. Crude protein content ranged from 11.24% to 17.81% (fixed at 14% moisture). We found that protein content was negatively correlated with yield and positively correlated with total amino acid content and days to harvest. Mean essential amino acids values met adult daily requirements but not leucine and lysine infant requirements. Yield was positively correlated with thousand seed weight and seed area, and negatively correlated with ash content and days to harvest. The accessions clustered into four groups, with one-group representing useful accessions for long-day breeding programs.

PTPN23 is a regulator of endosomal trafficking functioning to move activated membrane receptors, such as EGFR, from the endosomal sorting complex towards the ESCRT-III complex for multivesicular body biogenesis, lysosomal degradation, and subsequent downregulation of receptor signaling. Immunohistochemical study and RNAscope on developing mouse embryos showed broad expression of PTPN23 in oral tissues, while immunofluorescence showed that EGFR was specifically concentrated in the midline epithelium. Importantly, PTPN23 mutant protein was shown to have reduced phosphatase activity. In conclusion, mesiodens were associated with genetic variants in PTPN23, suggesting that mesiodens may form due to defects in endosomal trafficking, leading to disrupted midline signaling.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/689986/1/biology-12-00393-v2.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/689986/biology-12-00393-v2.pdf.txt,2023-03-05T13:10:08

Day 3 Fri, March 03, 2023. https://doi.org/10.2523/iptc-22959-ea","In this work, we studied the implementation of huff and puff technology to extract heat from the geothermal reservoir. Two-dimensional numerical investigations were carried out using a fully coupled two-phase thermo-hydro-mechanical model with dynamic rock and fluid properties. COMSOL Multiphysics (a finite element solver) was utilized to build the model. The CO2 geofluid is injected in a supercritical state in a water-saturated geothermal reservoir. The results were showing promising for the extraction of heat and storing of CO2. In the simulation model, we designed a well pair (two-vertical wells) system with two different operating perforations in the same well with huff and puff cycle operation, and this technology is named as Doublet Huff and Puff (DHP). Injection wells operating at the top of the formation and production wells are operating at the bottom. The injection well-1 and production well-1 are operating at same time (i.e., 2 years). During this period, injection well-2 and production well-2 are ideal, and injection well-1 and production well-1 are ideal while operating injection well-2 and production well-2. This process is continued till the whole reservoir is saturated with the injected CO2 and/or the reservoir temperature reaches 60 % (i.e., geothermal reservoir life) of its original temperature. The CO2 plume expanding throughout the reservoir effectively while extracting heat from the reservoir. The sensitivity of well distance, injection temperature, injection velocity, and perforation length on the production temperature was investigated. The production temperature stays stable and high for a long time and no influence on the production temperature. Thus, the proposed technique (DHP) can be implemented for sequestering large amounts of CO2 along with heat extraction in geothermal reservoirs.",,Published,,,2023-03-05T13:10:07

Specifically, TA sends signals to S in the presence of IA interference. Considering the trajectory, hierarchy, and safety distance of the aircraft’s flight routes, we propose a novel three-dimensional stacked Poisson line hardcore point process. That is, we introduce safety distances to the stacked Poisson line Cox process in order to describe the locations of IA in the sky. We also propose two approximations, namely, the equi-dense model and the discretization model, to maintain the tractability of the analysis. To this end, the uplink coverage probability is studied by using the two proposed mathematical models.

Gas displacement after water flooding is an effective way to recover residual oil, but the occurrence state and flow principles of multiphase fluid after gas injection are still ambiguous. Therefore, the gas displacement process after water flooding should be studied on the pore scale to provide a basis for formulating a reasonable gas injection program. Most of the current pore-scale studies focus on two-phase flow, while simulations that account for the influence of oil-gas miscibility and injected water are seldom reported. In this work, the multi-component multi-phase Shan-Chen lattice Boltzmann model is used to simulate the gas displacement after water flooding in a porous medium, and the effects of injected water, viscosity ratio, pore structure, and miscibility are analyzed. It is established that the injected water will cause gas flow path variations and lead to premature gas channeling. Under the impact of capillary pressure, the water retained in the porous medium during the water flooding stage further imbibes into the tiny pores during gas injection and displaces the remaining oil. When miscibility is considered, the oil-gas interface disappears, eliminating the influence of the capillary effect on the fluid flow and enabling the recovery of remaining oil at the corner. This study sheds light on the gas displacement mechanisms after water flooding from the pore-scale perspective and provides a potential avenue for improving oil recovery.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/689980/1/645-2486-3-PB.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/689980/645-2486-3-PB.pdf.txt,2023-03-05T11:50:10

Three different deconvolution analysis methods, i.e. the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with the maximum likelihood evaluation (MLE) algorithm, the probability distribution function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) with least square estimate (LSE) algorithm, were employed to analyze the nanoindentation test data. It was found that the GMM with a diagonal-unshared matrix is the most appropriate for the deconvolution of nanoindentation data of hydrated cement paste for the MLE algorithm. The PDF and CDF methods are equally effective for the LSE algorithm, but the former is subjected to the influences of bin sizes and the optimal bin size is 1.5–2 GPa for elastic modulus and 0.075–0.1 GPa for hardness. The threshold number of indentation points necessary to obtain reliable micromechanical parameters and phase contents by all three deconvolution methods is approximately 800-1000, significantly higher than the values used in the literature. The phase content seems to show more variations than elastic modulus and hardness when the number of indentation point is insufficient. With sufficient number of indentation points, the three different deconvolution methods give consistent results regarding the properties and contents of six phases identified. The various phase contents calculated by deconvolution of nanoindentation test data are in reasonable agreement with that estimated by QXRD and SEM except for the pore phase.",,Published,,,2023-03-05T11:40:11

This study reveals its significant application in the alkylation of benzene with methanol. The b-axis-oriented ZSM-5 nanosheets with similar acid property but varied thicknesses of about 30, 90, and 300 nm were prepared to investigate the effect of thickness on their catalytic properties for alkylation reactions. Comparative results demonstrate that the sample with a thickness of 30 nm exhibits higher benzene conversion, xylene selectivity, and methyl selectivity (up to 97%), accompanied by an ultralong lifetime (up to 1000 h, 10 times longer than that of the sample with a thickness of 300 nm) and lower byproduct ethylbenzene selectivity. This is ascribed to the shortened straight channel length, increased specific surface area, and enlarged mesopore volume that significantly facilitate the diffusion of reactants and products, increase the accessibility of acid sites, and decrease the coke formation. Moreover, compared with conventional ZSM-5 nanocrystals, ZSM-5 nanosheets deliver a substantially extended lifetime due to fewer framework defects. Most significantly, this study unravels the diffusion effect on ethylbenzene selectivity over ZSM-5 nanosheets with different thicknesses and illustrates the role of strong Brønsted acid sites in the dynamic changes of ethylbenzene selectivity. In light of the above analysis, we developed a precoking strategy and an introducing-heteroatom strategy to precisely tailor the catalyst acidity, further suppressing the ethylbenzene formation (<0.3%) while maintaining long-term stable operation (>300 h).",,Published,,,2023-03-05T11:30:11

This study aims to demonstrate how coupling wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) with meta-data can identify which factors contribute toward the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 within a local community. Throughout the pandemic, the temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations were tracked by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and analyzed in the context of the number of positive swab cases, the extent of human movement, and intervention measures. Our findings suggest that during the early phase of the pandemic, when strict lockdown was imposed, the viral titer load in the wastewater remained below detection limits, with <4 positive swab cases reported over a 14-day period in the compound. After the lockdown was lifted and global travel gradually resumed, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was first detected in the wastewater on 12 August 2020 and increased in frequency thereafter, despite high vaccination rates and mandatory face-covering requirements in the community. Accompanied by a combination of the Omicron surge and significant global travel by community members, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in most of the weekly wastewater samples collected in late December 2021 and January 2022. With the cease of mandatory face covering, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in at least two of the four weekly wastewater samples collected from May through August 2022. Retrospective Nanopore sequencing revealed the presence of the Omicron variant in the wastewater with a multitude of amino acid mutations, from which we could infer the likely geographical origins from which the variants were imported.

New research highlights the importance of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) for maintaining CV health Methods: We searched PubMed and MEDLINE for English and non-English articles with English abstracts published between 1957 (when the first report on IGF-1 identification was published) and 2022. The top search terms were: IGF-1, cardiovascular disease, IGF-1 receptors, IGF-1 and microRNAs, therapeutic interventions with IGF-1, IGF-1 and diabetes, IGF-1 and cardiovascular disease. The search retrieved original peer-reviewed articles, which were further analyzed, focusing on the role of IGF-1 in pathophysiological conditions. We specifically focused on including the most recent findings published in the past five years. Results: IGF-1, an anabolic growth factor, regulates cell division, proliferation, and survival. In addition to its well-known growth-promoting and metabolic effects, there is mounting evidence that IGF-1 plays a specialized role in the complex activities that underpin CV function. IGF-1 promotes cardiac development and improves cardiac output, stroke volume, contractility, and ejection fraction. Furthermore, IGF-1 mediates many growth hormones (GH) actions. IGF-1 stimulates contractility and tissue remodeling in humans to improve heart function after myocardial infarction. IGF-1 also improves the lipid profile, lowers insulin levels, increases insulin sensitivity, and promotes glucose metabolism. These findings point to the intriguing medicinal potential of IGF-1. Human studies associate low serum levels of free or total IGF-1 with an increased risk of CV and cerebrovascular illness. Extensive human trials are being conducted to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and outcomes of IGF-1-related therapy.

The rapid development of power electronics technology has allowed the converters to operate at DC voltage levels required for transmission, distribution and consumption. However, the coordination among power electronic converters can lead to malicious intrusions that aim to manipulate microgrids' operation and cause deviation from their mission-critical objectives. Such manipulations may lead to disturbances during motion, thus posing serious risks to passenger lives and cargo. The disturbances can also affect operations in critical sectors such as commercial transportation and defence, which may directly influence the global economy and national security.

We elucidate the relationship between metal–support electronic interactions and catalytic activity on size-selected singe layered platinum plates Ptn (n = 10, 20, 30, and 45) supported on a Si (111)-7 × 7 reconstructed surface (Si-RS). Our first-principles density functional theory study shows that CO oxidation catalysis over Pt supported on the nonreducible Si-RS is affected by variations in charge transfer, cluster size, and electronic interactions between clusters and support. CO adsorbs on Ptn adsorption sites in two distinct ranges of adsorption energies, which explains the experimentally observed two different desorption temperatures of CO. Pt30/Si-RS is more active than other Ptn/Si-RS under the same conditions, showing markedly enhanced catalytic activity in terms of high turnover frequency of CO2 production. This superior activity originates from the optimum CO and O2 adsorption on Pt30 arising from the position of the d-band center being midway between their π orbitals. Experimental observations convey that the TOFs of CO2 production on Pt30(45)/Si-RS are very high, and these are tolerant to CO poisoning between 450 and 550 K. DFT computations of TOF on Pt30(45)/Si-RS for CO2 validate the experimentally observed trends at 350, 450, and 550 K and exhibit that the CO oxidation activity exceeds that of the conventional catalysts between 450 and 550 K.

The most significant advances have historically utilized intraspecific variation, introgression of traits from close crop wild relatives, or, less frequently, introgression from more distant relatives. Advanced lines often fail due to difficulties in the introgression or tracking of traits or due to yield penalties associated with the alleles in nonsaline environments. However, the greatest limitation is that salinity is not a primary trait for breeders. We must close the gap between research and delivery, especially for farmers who have precious few alternatives. These efforts should include a reassessment of old techniques such as grafting current crops with salt-tolerant hybrid rootstocks.

Due to heavy-metal contamination, water becomes unfit for drinking for human beings, which in long term may cause several disorders. Thus, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) recovered from waste, such as CFA, could be the most promising material for treating wastewater, due to their low-cost, recyclable nature and magnetic property. The synthesis of IONPs from CFA involves three sequential steps. The first step involves extraction of ferrous materials from CFA, followed by acidic treatment of ferrous materials to obtain acidic leachate, and lastly the precipitation of iron oxides by an alkali. The particle size of the synthesized IONPs varied from 30–70 nm and purity was about 90–93%, as confirmed by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and electron diffraction spectroscopy (EDS). Further, the synthesized IONPs were used for the remediation of various heavy metals, especially Pb and Cr ions from 20% CFA aqueous solutions.

In this work, ignition delay times (IDTs) of syngas have been measured in CO2 diluted conditions using a high-pressure shock tube at two pressures (20 and 40 bar) over a temperature range of 1100 – 1300 K. Syngas mixtures in this study were varied in equivalence ratio and H2:CO ratios. The datasets were compared against the predictions of AramcoMech 2.0 and the University of Sheffield supercritical CO2 2.0 (UoS sCO2 2.0) kinetic models. Quantitative comparative analysis showed that the UoS sCO2 2.0 was superior in its ability to predict the experimental IDTs of syngas combustion. We found that the reaction of CO2 and H to form CO and OH caused the separation of H2 and CO ignition in two events, which increased the complexity of determining the IDTs. We investigated this phenomenon and proposed a method to determine simulated IDTs for an effective comparison against the experimental IDTs. The chemical kinetics of syngas combustion in a CO2 and N2 bath gas are contrasted by sensitivity and rate-of-production analyses.

Composites of Salt and Porous Matrix (CSPMs) are promising functional materials for water vapor sorption. Here, CSPMs were synthesized by loading SAPO-34 porous crystals with highly hygroscopic salts, namely LiCl and CaCl2, individually (mono-salt systems) or combined (binary salt systems) to enhance water sorption capacity and cyclability. The LiCl and CaCl2 content in the impregnation solution impacted the sorption behavior and equilibrium capacity of the resulting composites. Physicochemical, morphological, textural, and sorption properties were evaluated showing that the confinement of binary salts yielded the highest water uptake (0.88 gw/gads at 25 °C and 90 % RH), which was four times higher than that of the parent SAPO-34. The shape of the obtained water vapor isotherms revealed that the salts introduced into the porous structure led to significant changes in the sorption mechanism, with SAPO-34 following a Langmuir behavior (type I isotherm) and the composites a type II isotherm with associated multilayer formation due to the presence of the salts. Kinetic studies also revealed that the materials follow a PSO model dominated by water-surface interactions.

Future projection of the African easterly waves in a high-resolution AGCM. https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-4141","African Easterly Waves (AEWs) are a significant control of West African rainfall and the associated Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs) and squall lines embedded within them. More than 40% of the total MCSs over the region are associated with AEWs and these MCSs account for approximately 80% of the total annual rainfall over the Sahel. Approximately 60% of all Atlantic hurricanes and 80% of major hurricanes have their genesis associated with AEWs. Simulating the features of AEWs, such as their westward propagation off the east Atlantic coast, is challenging for coarse-resolution climate models. In this study, we use High-Resolution Atmospheric Model (HiRAM) to simulate AEWs and analyze their future projections by the end of the 21st century. The simulations are performed globally at a horizontal resolution of 25km. The model uses shallow convective parameterization for moist convection and stratiform cloudiness. Future projections are conducted using representative concentration pathway 8.5. AEWs are separated with respect to their periods as 3–5 and 6–9-day period AEWs, and bandpass filtering is used to filter the waves from the mean flow. HiRAM simulates the structure and propagation of the waves well; however, it tends to overestimate the associated precipitation. In the future, the AEW precipitation and intensity of the circulation will considerably increase. The northward extent of the AEW track also shows a significant increase in the future. Enhanced baroclinic overturning and eddy available potential energy generated due to diabatic heating is also observed in the future.",,Published,,,2023-03-01T17:20:07

Dust also hampers solar energy harvesting by weakening downward solar flux and depositing on optically active surfaces of solar energy devices. In this study, we combine fine-resolution WRF-Chem simulations with size-segregated measurements of dust deposition to quantify the contribution of coarse (2.5 um < r < 10 um) and giant (10 um <r < 100 um) dust particles in aerosols radiative forcing and deposition rates. Most up-to-date models do not represent the particles with r > 10 um. The absence of large particles in the models does not significantly affect the radiative fluxes, as their contribution to AOD is relatively small, but they comprise the most dust-deposited mass. We found that dust deposition rates calculated in WRF-Chem and reanalysis products are 2-3 times smaller than the observed. However, the deposition rate of particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 10 um (PM10) is in good agreement between the models and observations. In the Middle East, fine dust particles are predominantly responsible for the significant reduction (> 5 %) of the downward solar flux hampering solar energy production. Still, dust-deposited mass, primarily associated with coarse particles, causes about a 2% loss of PV panel efficiency daily due to soiling. As was suggested previously, WRF-Chem, like many other models, tends to overestimate the atmospheric concentration of fine (r < 2.5 um) dust particles and underestimate the concentration of coarse particles. As seen from the comparison of the size distribution of deposited dust in simulations and observations, the latter is caused not as much by too fast deposition of large particles but due to underestimating their emission in the models.",,Published,,,2023-03-01T17:20:07

(2023). Impact of Forestation and Land-use Changes on Desert Climate. https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-1745","Growing forests is an effective way of removing CO2 from the atmosphere. Forestation projects were started in China, Germany, and the Middle East. Saudi Arabia announced its ambitious “Saudi Green Initiative,” intending to plant ten billion trees. Given the insufficient rainfall to support the initiative, vegetated areas will require irrigation, effectively increasing evaporation. In addition, those areas have a lower albedo than bare land, absorbing more solar radiation. Enhancing precipitation due to the recycling of evaporated water is important as it reduces the amount of freshwater required for irrigation. In this study, we focus on the regional climate impact of irrigated forested or vegetated areas on temperature and precipitation over the Arabian Peninsula to quantify their effect on livability and evaluate the water recycling potential. First, we studied the climate effect of irrigated farming developing over vast areas in Saudi Arabia since the 1980s. The agricultural areas were mapped using available satellite-based observations from the Landsat platforms, which capture optical and thermal data every 16 days at a resolution of 30 m to 100 m. Second, we projected the climate impact of widespread forestation over the Arabian Peninsula. The analysis of the long-term precipitation changes caused by irrigated farming is hindered by the lack of in situ observations and the limitations of global-scale observation data sets. Most reanalysis products have contradictory evaporation trends and indicate an overall reduction in rainfall since the 1980s. The recycled precipitation cannot be estimated reliably because of reanalysis increments and background rainfall variability. Presumably, the local increase in rains occurs downstream of the irrigated areas rather than over them. Along with the analysis of observations, we conducted numerical experiments mimicking the effect of irrigated agricultural fields using a non-hydrostatic regional meteorological model (WRF), covering the whole Arabian Peninsula by a 9x9 km2 grid, with 3x3 km2 nesting over the irrigated areas. Irrigation water is accounted for by tagging moisture evaporated from agricultural regions. The amount of tagged water vapor falling as rain represents recycled precipitation. The simulated evaporation and local temperature response strongly depends on the level of irrigation. Large-scale subsidence suppresses the local deep convection over most parts of the Arabian Peninsula. Strong turbulence quickly mixes evaporated water vapor within a six km thick atmospheric boundary layer, preventing precipitation in shallow convection so that the fraction of recycled rainfall appears to be low.",,Published,,,2023-03-01T17:10:10

Simulation of ground motions with high frequency components obtained from Fourier neural operators. https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-9036","Seismic hazards analysis relies on accurate knowledge of ground motions arising from potential earthquakes to assess the risk of damage to buildings and infrastructure. It is necessary to perform ground motion simulations because recorded strong-motion data from specific combinations of earthquake magnitudes, epicentral distances, and site conditions are still limited. Physics-based simulations provide reliable ground motion estimates, but their application in practice is limited to frequency ranges f < 1Hz, largely due to limited computational resources and lack of information regarding earthquake sources and medium. While hybrid ground-motion computations combining deterministic low frequency components with stochastic high frequency components are often used, their stochastic high frequency components fail to correctly account for source and path effects and lead to inconsistent building responses. The large database of ground motion records from Japan lends itself to develop machine learning approaches to estimate high frequency ground motions. Applying state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, like Fourier neural operators (FNOs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we estimate seismograms at higher frequencies from their low frequency counterparts. In our approach, the time and frequency properties of ground motions are estimated using two different FNO models. In the time domain, a relationship is established between normalised low pass filtered and broadband waveforms. Frequency domain analysis involves the learning of high frequency spectrum from low frequency spectrum. Finally, the time and frequency properties are combined to produce broadband ground motions. Source, site, and path aspects are naturally incorporated into the training process. We use ground motion data collected between 1996 and 2020 at 18 stations in the Ibaraki province of Japan to train our models and validate them on different events (Mw 4 to 7) around Japan. Using goodness of fit measures (GOFs), we show that the resulting ground motions match the recorded observations with good to acceptable GOF values for most of the predictions. To enhance our predictions, we include uncertainty estimation by utilizing a conditioned GAN approach. Lastly, to demonstrate the practicality of the approach, we compute high frequency components for a physics based simulated hypothetical Mw 5.0 earthquake in Japan.",,Published,,,2023-03-01T16:50:10

The first network of Ocean Bottom Seismometers in the Red Sea to investigate the Zabargad Fracture Zone. https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-11372","The Red Sea (RS) is an ideal natural laboratory to study the transition from continental rifting to seafloor spreading because it is one of the youngest rift basins on Earth. The RS is an ultra-slow spreading rift with an opening rate that decreases from 15 mm/yr in the south, at the Nubian-Arabian-Danakil triple junction, to 7 mm/yr in the north where it connects to the Dead Sea transform fault. While the southern RS has a well-developed seafloor spreading ridge with an axis parallel to the rift bounding faults, images of the northern RS seafloor provide limited information because of thick evaporite layers covering the main tectonic features. Nevertheless, the northern rift axis is geometrically different as it is more oblique to the bounding faults than in the south. Furthermore, the transition between the southern and northern RS is sharp with a ~100 km rift axis offset, named Zabargad Fracture Zone (ZFZ). However, the current knowledge of the seismic activity, transform fault configuration, and the crustal and upper mantle structure of the ZFZ area is too limited to assess the seismic hazard associated with this rift offset and understand the role of the ZFZ in the RS development. To fill this gap, we deployed the first broadband seismic network in the Red Sea, within the ZFZ, from November 2021 to November 2022. This network included 12 Lobster OBSs from the DEPAS pool (equipped with Güralp CMG-40T-OBS sensors), 2 additional Trillium Compact sensors deployed directly on the seafloor mounted on minimalist frames through a collaboration with the company Fugro, as well as 2 Trillium Compact Horizon and 2 posthole sensors deployed on islands and inland in Saudi Arabia, respectively. The overall data recovery rate is above 90%. Also, our preliminary data analysis confirms some of the known issues of the Lobster OBSs and their sensors (strong self-noise at periods >10 s of the Güralp sensors and high-frequency harmonic noise due to head-buoy cable strumming). Furthermore, we conducted a systematic comparison of the noise recorded by different station configurations. We find that while Lobster OBSs with a head-buoy cable set free to strum generate strong noise at about 10 Hz and its overtones, Lobster OBSs with tight cable still display harmonic noise from 10 to 40 Hz that increases during bad weather conditions, probably due to resonance of other OBS elements. The Fugro OBSs, despite their minimalist deployment setup, show noise at 40 Hz that also resonates in bad weather. All the OBSs also display a peak of noise between 0.5 and 5 Hz (separated from the secondary microseismic peak). While such a noise peak is not recorded by the inland stations, it is well exhibited by the two island stations suggesting that this is due to locally ocean-generated seismic waves, but not by the OBS frames. At periods >10 s, the Fugro OBSs perform as well as the island and inland stations. In fact, waveforms of teleseismic earthquakes recorded by the Fugro OBSs and island and inland stations have comparable signal-to-noise ratios.",,Published,,,2023-03-01T16:50:10

The first mainshock started close to the well-known East Anatolian Fault (EAF) and then rupturing more than 300 km of that fault, whereas the second large earthquake occurred nine hours later around 90 km north of the first mainshock, on an east-west trending fault. In this study, we analysed recorded strong ground motions from the two events to better understand the factors contributing to the devastation caused by the earthquakes. For this, we collected 250 and 200 strong ground motion records for the first and the second event, respectively, from the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) in Türkiye. Maximum peak ground accelerations (PGA) of 2g were observed at a distance of 31 km northeast of the first mainshock epicenter and 0.6g for the second event 65km west to its epicenter. In addition, we find particularly high amplitude ground motions in the Hatay province for the first event, which is consistent with the extent of damage reported in that region. High shaking levels in Antakya and other parts of Hatay can be explained by a combination of strong directivity and local site effects. The results of our analysis imply that the PGA values derived from two local ground motion models (GMMs), adopted for the 2018 Turkish hazard map, are underestimated in comparison to observed strong motion recordings. In addition, we also compared observed peak and spectral ground motion characteristics with estimated seismic hazard values (10% probability to exceed in 50 years) in the East Anatolian Fault region (extracted from the 2018 Turkish seismic hazard map). Furthermore, we compare the recorded response spectra with the Turkish design code for several locations around the main faults. The results show that the observations greatly exceed the hazard values and code guidelines in the Hatay province.",,Published,,,2023-03-01T16:40:10

The rupture of the first mainshock (M7.8) initiated just south of the East Anatolian Fault (EAF) and then ruptured bilaterally hundreds of km of the EAF, causing major stress changes in the region and triggering the second mainshock (M7.6) about 9 hours later. We mapped the surface ruptures of the two mainshocks using pixel-offset tracking of Sentinel-1 radar images and find them to be ~300 km and 100-150 km long. The distribution of aftershocks indicates that the fault ruptures may have been even longer at depth, or about ~350 km and ~170 km, respectively. The pixel-tracking results and finite-fault modeling of the spatially variable fault slip show up to 7 and 8 m of surface fault offsets at the two faults, respectively, and that fault slip was shallow in both events, mostly above 15 km. In addition, our back-projection analysis suggests the first mainshock ruptured from the hypocenter to the northeast towards the EAF (first ~15 sec), then continued along it to the northeast (until ~55 sec), and also to the southwest towards the Hatay province, later at high rupture speeds (until ~80 sec). Furthermore, strong motion recordings show PGA values up to 2g and are particularly severe in Hatay, where multiple stations show over 0.5g PGA values. Both events are characterized by abrupt rupture cessation, generating strong stopping phases that likely contributed to the observed high shaking levels. Together the results show that directivity effects, high rupture speed, strong stopping phases, and local site effects all contributed to the intensive shaking and damage in the Hatay province.",,Published,,,2023-03-01T16:30:11

During inference, each input image is automatically routed to the appropriate head using a latent classifier. Our framework admits multiple configurations depending on the datasets used for relative depth pre-training and metric fine-tuning.

Pre-training on twelve datasets and fine-tuning on the NYU Depth v2 indoor dataset, we can further improve SOTA for a total of 21% in terms of relative absolute error (REL).

In the current study, we assessed the biochemical, histological, and microscopic evaluations of testicular damage following CYP administration. Further, we have explored the potential protective impact of mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) transplantation. The biochemical results revealed that ad-ministration of CYP increased serum concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and lu-teinizing hormone (LH), while it decreased serum concentrations of free testosterone hormone (TH), testicular FSH, LH, and free TH concentrations, testicular total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and testicular activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme. The histology and sperm examinations revealed that CYP induced destruction to the architectures of several tissues in the testes, which drastically reduced the Johnsen score as well as the spermatogenesis process. Surprisingly, trans-plantation of MSCs after CYP administration altered the deterioration effect of CYP injury on the testicular tissues, as demonstrated by biochemical and histological analysis. Our results indicated alleviation of serum and testicular sex hormones, as well as testicular oxidative stress markers (TAC and SOD activity), and nearly restored the normal appearance of the testicular tissues, Johnsen score, and spermatogenesis process.

Early warning systems of natural hazards are one of the most effective measure for reducing disaster losses and risks. However, the forecast of RTL in near-real-time (NRT) is extremely difficult since the quality of NRT precipitation data is relatively poor. Quantile regression forest (QRF), a state-of-the-art statistical postprocessing method, has been proved to reduce the difference existing between NRT satellite precipitation estimates and ground-based rainfall data. When predicted rainfall maps are put side by side with raw NRT satellite product, the pattern of the first matches much more closely the locations where landslide events have been mapped in a test site in North-Eastern Turkey. This leave an optimistic perspective on the application of statistical postprocessing techniques in the field of weather science and in general for natural hazard assessment. Ideally, by correcting the continuous information in space and time provided by satellite rainfall estimates, one could create a new operational tool for landslide early warning system, not bound to the financial and deployment requirement typical of rain gauge and terrestrial radar stations.",,Published,,,2023-03-01T16:00:07

Quantifying lifetime water scarcity. https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-7949","Water scarcity is a growing concern in many regions worldwide, as demand for clean water increases and supply becomes increasingly uncertain under climate change. Already today, more than 4 billion people experience water scarcity at least one month per year (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2016). Developing socio-economic conditions and growing population increase water demands, while climate change leads to changes in freshwater availability. Most studies quantify water scarcity in discrete time windows, with fixed population and climate change signals (e.g., 30 years or long-term averages). Recently, however, Thiery et al. (2021) proposed a novel approach, in which climate change impacts are integrated over a person's lifetime. In this cohort perspective, lifetime impact values are comparable across generations and regions. Evaluating this perspective for natural hazards, they showed, for example, that a newborn will experience a sixfold increase in drought exposure compared to a 60-year-old (Thiery et al., 2021). In this study, we use this cohort perspective to study how much water scarcity a person experiences during their lifetime. Based on monthly fluctuations in water demand and availability, we estimate the total amount of water demand not met and refer to it as 'lifetime water deficit'. To this end, we use an ensemble of four global hydrological models (MATSIRO, CWatM, LPJmL and H08), each forced by four GCMs and two RCP scenarios from the InterSectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP2b). The simulations account for varying population and socio-economic conditions in the historical and future period, following the SSP2 scenario. Combined with country-based population, cohort distribution and life expectancies, lifetime water deficits are quantified for different generations on a country level. Our findings reveal high water lifetime deficit values for regions that are already water scarce today, such as the Mediterranean, North Africa and the Middle East. In these regions, more than 70% of the lifetime water demand is not met when needed. Further comparison reveals differences in spatial, intergenerational and climate change scenarios, and provides information on different scenarios. Overall, this study provides a new perspective on quantifying water scarcity and the climate and population impacts.",,Published,,,2023-03-01T15:00:08

Although being characterized by extreme environmental conditions (i.e., low water temperatures, oligotrophy) GFSs host an underappreciated microbial biodiversity, especially within benthic biofilms which play pivotal roles in downstream biogeochemical cycles. Yet, we still lack a global overview of the GFS biofilm microbiome. In addition, little is known on how environmental conditions shape bacterial diversity, and how these relationships drive global distribution patterns. This is particularly important as mountain glaciers are currently vanishing at a rapid pace due to global warming. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing data from the Vanishing Glaciers project to conduct a first comprehensive analysis of the benthic microbiome from 148 GFSs across 11 mountain ranges. Our analyses revealed marked biogeographic patterns in the GFS microbiome, mainly driven by the replacement of phylogenetically closely related taxa. Strikingly, the GFS microbiome was characterized by pronounced level of endemism, with >58% of the Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) being specific to one mountain range. Consistent with the marked dissimilarities across mountain ranges, we found a very small taxonomic core including only 200 ASVs, yet accounting for >25% of the total relative abundance of the ASVs. Finally, we found that spatial effects such as dispersal limitation, isolation and spatially autocorrelated environmental conditions overwhelmed the effect of the environment by itself on benthic biofilm beta diversity. Our findings shed light on the previously unresolved global diversity and biogeography of the GFS microbiome now at risk across the world’s major mountain ranges because of rapidly shrinking glaciers.",,Published,,,2023-03-01T15:00:08

We propose a new nonlinear and time-inhomogeneous SDE model with a Jacobi-type diffusion term for the phenomenon of interest, simultaneously driven by the forecast and the constraining upper bound. We rigorously demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of a strong solution to the SDE model by imposing a condition for the time-varying mean-reversion parameter appearing in the drift term. The normalized forecast function is thresholded to keep such mean-reversion parameters bounded. The SDE model parameter calibration also covers the thresholding parameter of the normalized forecast by applying a novel iterative two-stage optimization procedure to user-selected approximations of the likelihood function. Another novel contribution is estimating the transition density of the forecast error process, not known analytically in a closed form, through a tailored kernel smoothing technique with the control variate method. We fit the model to the 2019 photovoltaic (PV) solar power daily production and forecast data in Uruguay, computing the daily maximum solar PV production estimation. Two statistical versions of the constrained SDE model are fit, with the beta and truncated normal distributions as proxies for the transition density. Empirical results include simulations of the normalized solar PV power production and pathwise confidence bands generated through an indirect inference method. An objective comparison of optimal parametric points associated with the two selected statistical approximations is provided by applying the innovative kernel density estimation technique of the transition function of the forecast error process.",,"Under Review",https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/689875/1/2302.13133.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/689875/2302.13133.pdf.txt,2023-03-01T14:40:06

We then apply this strategy to discovering thermoelectric materials where we prioritize synthesis at temperatures < 300{\deg}C. We document a previously unreported chemical family of thermoelectric materials, PbSe:SnSb, finding that the best candidate in this chemical family, 2 wt% SnSb doped PbSe, exhibits a power factor more than 2x that of PbSe. Our investigations show that our closed-loop experimentation strategy reduces the required number of experiments to find an optimized material by as much as 3x compared to high-throughput searches powered by state-of-the-art machine learning models.

Cyanidioschyzon merolae 10D is a cell wall deficient species with a fully sequenced genome that is amenable to nuclear transgene integration by targeted homologous recombination. C. merolae maintains a minimal carotenoid profile and here, we sought to determine its capacity for ketocarotenoid accumulation mediated by heterologous expression of a green algal beta-carotene ketolase (BKT) and hydroxylase (CHYB). To achieve this, a synthetic transgene expression cassette system was built to integrate and express Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Cr) sourced enzymes by fusing native C. merolae transcription, translation and chloroplast targeting signals to codon-optimized coding sequences. Chloramphenicol resistance was used to select for the integration of synthetic linear DNAs into a neutral site within the host genome. CrBKT expression caused accumulation of canthaxanthin and adonirubin as major carotenoids while co-expression of CrBKT with CrCHYB generated astaxanthin as the major carotenoid in C. merolae. Unlike green algae and plants, ketocarotenoid accumulation in C. merolae did not reduce total carotenoid contents, but chlorophyll a reduction was observed. Light intensity affected global ratios of all pigments but not individual pigment compositions and phycocyanin contents were not markedly different between parental strain and transformants. Continuous illumination was found to encourage biomass accumulation and all strains could be cultivated in simulated summer conditions from two different extreme desert environments.

In particular, described herein is the recent development in synthesis of PdNPs through a greener setup in which phytochemicals present in plant extract will acts as a heterogeneous support and thus the need of external ligand is avoided. The detailed analysis of utilization of various plant extract for PdNPs synthesis and its characterization and application is specifically elaborated. The PdNPs have been synthesized from extracts of various portions of the plants in which presence of terpenes, citric acid, flavonoids, phenols, ascorbic acid, alkaloids, and reductase acts as potential reducing agents and stabilizers in nanoparticles synthesis. More importantly, higher surface area and optimum porosity are important factors in PdNPs to exhibit good catalytic activity. Notably, in a regular approach, reduction of Pd(II) to Pd(0) requires the expensive ligands, while in case of PdNPs' catalyzed transformation, it is achieved by phytochemicals present in the plant extract. In the later stage of the chapter, utilization of synthesized PdNPs for various organic transformations (e.g., Suzuki, Kumada, Sonogashira Heck, Suzuki-Miyaura, Negishi, Stille, or Kumada) is mainly described.

Improving the grain production characteristics of a perennial forage grass to economically viable levels is a long-term endeavor that was undertaken because of the potential for profound benefits to farmers, human society, and the environment. Even before research as a perennial grain, IWG has had a history of improvement as a forage species, and as one of wheat's closest perennial relatives it has also been used to transfer desirable traits into annual wheat. Since initial work in the 1980s, long-term breeding programs have been initiated in Kansas, Minnesota, and Utah (United States), Manitoba (Canada), and Uppsala (Sweden). Coupling advances in molecular technologies, many of these programs have harnessed the power of genomic selection and other cutting-edge tools to rapidly improve IWG. This has resulted in estimated gains of up to 8% per year for spike yield, and across eight breeding cycles grain yield has increased 9% per cycle, yet another 23 breeding cycles may be required before IWG yields are comparable to annual wheat. In addition to improving key domestication and agronomic traits, molecular research has provided a wealth of information about the genomic regions controlling trait expression through linkage mapping and genome-wide association studies.

Modeling of the mineralization during GCS relies on numerical reservoir simulation, but the computational cost is prohibitively high due to the complex physical processes. Therefore, deep learning (DL) models can be used as a computationally cheaper and at the same time, reliable alternative to the conventional numerical simulators. In this work, we have developed a DL approach to effectively predict the dissolution and precipitation of various important minerals, including Anorthite, Kaolinite, and Calcite during CO2 injection into deep saline aquifers. We established a reservoir model to simulate the process of geological CO2 storage. About 750 simulations were performed in order to generate a comprehensive dataset for training DL models. Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) models were trained on the simulated dataset, which take the reservoir and well properties along with time information as input and predict the precipitation and dissolution of minerals in space and time scales. During the training process, root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) was chosen as the loss function to avoid overfitting. To gauge prediction performance, we applied the trained model to predict the concentrations of different mineral on the test dataset, which is 10% of the entire dataset, and two metrics, including the average absolute percentage error (AAPE) and the coefficient of determination (R2) were adopted. The R2 value was found to be around 0.95 for calcite model, 0.94 for Kaolinite model, and 0.93 for Anorthite model. The R2 was calculated for all trainable points from the predictions and ground truth. On the other hand, the average AAPE for all the mappings was calculated around 1%, which demonstrates that the trained model can effectively predict the temporal and spatial evolution of the mineral concentrations. The prediction CPU time (0.2 seconds/case) by the model is much lower than that of the physics-based reservoir simulator (3600 seconds/case). Therefore, the proposed method offers predictions as accurate as our physics-based reservoir simulations, while provides a huge saving of computation time. To the authors' best knowledge, prediction of the precipitation and dissolution of minerals in a supervised learning approach using the simulation data has not been studied before in the literature. The DL models developed in this study can serve as a computationally faster alternative to conventional numerical simulators to assess mineralization trapping in GCS projects especially for the mineral trapping mechanism.",,Published,,,2023-03-01T11:40:08

The successful implementation of GCS requires a comprehensive risk assessment of the confinement of plumes at each potential storage site. The accurate prediction of the flow, geochemical, and geomechanical responses of the formation is essential for the management of GCS in long-term operations because excessive pressure buildup due to injection can potentially induce fracturing of the cap-rock, or activate pre-existing faults, through which fluid can leak. In this study, we build a Deep Learning (DL) workflow to effectively infer the storage potential of CO2 in deep saline aquifers. Specifically, a reservoir model is built to simulate the process of CO2 injection into deep saline aquifers, which considers the coupled phenomenon of flow and hydromechanics. Further, the reservoir model was sampled to account for a wide range of petro-physical, geological, and operational parameters. These samples generated a massive physics-informed simulation database (about 1500 simulated data points) that provides training data for the DL workflow. The ranges of varied parameters were obtained from an extensive literature survey. The DL workflow consists of Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to take the input of the parameterized variables used in the simulation database and jointly predict the temporal-spatial responses of pressure and CO2 saturation plumes at different periods. Average Absolute Percentage Error (AAPE) and coefficient of determination (R2), Structural similarity index (SSIM), and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) are used as error metrics to evaluate the performance of the DL workflow. Through our blind testing experiments, the DL workflow offers predictions as accurate as our physics-based reservoir simulations, yet 300 times more efficient than the latter. The developed workflow shows superior performance with an AAPE of less than 5% and R2 score of more than 0.99 between actual and predicted values. The workflow can predict other required outputs that numerical simulators can typically calculate, such as solubility trapping, mineral trapping, and injected fluid densities in supercritical and aqueous phases.

The results show that, in addition to the excitation frequencies, a notable flame response can also be observed at the interaction frequency, where the corresponding velocity fluctuation is relatively small. This result means that, at the interaction frequency, the velocity fluctuation contributes little to the flame response. Such interacted response generally occurs at intermediate excitation frequencies but disappears as either excitation frequency is below the cut-off frequency. And it increases linearly with the excitation amplitude, with nearly zero dependence on the phase difference. Furthermore, the flame front is extracted based on the chemiluminescence images to analyze the flame area fluctuation. The resultant phase response implies that the fluctuation of the difference frequency propagates downstream convectively, similar to that of the excitation frequencies. Interestingly, the flame area fluctuation at the difference frequency shows significant response and a low-pass characteristic, whereas the CH* fluctuation approaches zero at those low frequencies.",,Published,,,2023-03-01T11:20:11

On many occasions, human interference can reduce the scale of a problem and enhance efficiency, but it has limitations, especially when working with big data and complex machines. This work utilizes in-cutter force sensing data and a scaled-drilling rig to apply an AI-based solution and facilitate drilling optimization. There are several experimental challenges to building an advisory system: tuning the PID controller, continuous communication and feedback between hardware and software, data synchronization, and system efficiency. The core capability that enables drilling optimization is in-cutter sensing, which allows evaluating the forces acting on a PDC cutter. Initially, an extensive experimental study is conducted to record and process the drilling data with sharp cutters. Weight on bit, torque, rotational speed and rate of penetration are measured and sampled at the same frequency as the in-cutter force sensing. Rock samples with different mechanical properties are utilized and tested in atmospheric conditions. The AI-based solution utilizes the data from the PDC cutter and the scaled-drilling rig structure to identify the optimum range of the drilling parameters depending on the mechanical properties of the rock samples. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is utilized to predict the rate of penetration for samples with different uniaxial compressive strength. The supervised machine-learning models are trained on input variables such as weight on bit, torque, rotational speed, uniaxial compressive strength, vibrations, and more importantly the measured force at the PDC cutter. A physics constraint is applied for torque, weight on bit and vibrations to guarantee that the output of the ML model is within the operating ranges. For each sample, approximately 100 data points are extracted per variable, with 70% for training, 15% for validation and 15% for testing. Cross-validation is used to enhance the robustness of the ML model. The results show that prediction performance is enhanced when the in-cutter sensing measurement is implemented as an input variable. The reliability of the ML models is tested on samples with different mechanical properties, with the results indicating an accurate prediction of the rate of penetration. The paper demonstrates an innovative workflow that combines AI and in-cutter sensing data to enhance the drilling efficiency with respect to system's mechanical limitations.

We focus on the case that the global reward is a sum of local rewards, the joint policy factorizes into agents' marginals, and full state observability. To date, few global optimality guarantees exist even for this simple setting, as most results yield convergence to stationarity for parameterized policies in large/possibly continuous spaces. To solidify the foundations of MARL, we build upon linear programming (LP) reformulations, for which stochastic primal-dual methods yield a model-free approach to achieve optimal sample complexity in the centralized case.

We establish that the sample complexity to obtain near-globally optimal solutions matches tight dependencies on the cardinality of the state and action spaces, and exhibits classical scalings with respect to the network in accordance with multi-agent optimization.

Each cell consists of two equivalent memristors in series. Applying an increasing voltage within the threshold range across the cell causes the memristor with a lower threshold to change state before the other. This uncertainty is then digitized to produce a random output. The design has no area/power hungry CMOS comparator overhead. Instead, only an output memristor holds the PUF response bit. The PUF signature is extracted during the set process. The proposed PUF cell which consists of two filament memristor sub-models connected in series is modeled, designed, implemented, and simulated using SystemC-AMS. Simulation results show that the effect of the sneak path does not alter the PUF response.",,Published,,,2023-03-01T11:00:11

Capturing such characteristics in a neural network model for the efficient application of processing tasks, like denoising, first arrival picking, velocity estimation, and so on, offer a more effective approach to incorporating machine learning in processing than training neural networks for specific tasks that may or may not transfer well to new data. We introduce a framework for seismic processing that allows us to pre-train a neural network to learn the features of a seismic dataset, and then fine-tune that network for any downstream processing task. We take advantage of the fact that most processing tasks utilize the same features embedded in the seismic dataset, and thus, these features can be stored in a common pre-trained network in a self-supervised manner, we refer to as StorSeismic. In this framework, we utilize a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model to promote pre-training for storing the features of a seismic dataset and then efficiently fine-tune it to adapt to a wide spectrum of seismic processing tasks. We apply this framework on field data, along with synthetically generated data, in the self-supervised pre-training step to store the seismic features. Then, we use the labeled synthetic data to fine-tune the pre-trained network in a supervised fashion to perform various seismic processing tasks, like denoising, low frequency extrapolation, first arrival picking, and velocity estimation, and finally obtain satisfactory inference results on the field data.",,Published,,,2023-03-01T09:50:09

In particular, we have three parallel branches. In the alignment branch, we adopt a two-stage training scheme, i.e., self-supervised pretraining and constrained unsupervised training using our proposed skip correlation attention layer and constrained loss. Synchronously, in the clustering branch, the learned deep cluster features are utilized to iteratively cluster subtomograms into groups using pseudo-labels from an image-wise Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Meanwhile, in the segmentation branch, we use rough pseudo-labels generated from a voxel-wise GMM as supervision signals, and prior knowledge from humans is utilized to jointly learn how to correct these labels as well as predict reliable segmentation results.

They play crucial roles in the formation and aging of secondary organic aerosols and in fuel autoignition. However, the concentration of organic hydroperoxides is seldom measured, and typical estimates have large uncertainties. In this work, we developed a mild and environmental-friendly method for the synthesis of alkyl hydroperoxides (ROOH) with various structures, and we systematically measured the absolute photoionization cross-sections (PICSs) of the ROOHs using synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet-photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS). A chemical titration method was combined with an SVUV-PIMS measurement to obtain the PICS of 4-hydroperoxy-2-pentanone, a typical molecule for combustion and atmospheric autoxidation ketohydroperoxides (KHPs). We found that organic hydroperoxide cations are largely dissociated by loss of OOH. This fingerprint was used for the identification and accurate quantification of the organic peroxides, and it can therefore be used to improve models for autoxidation chemistry. The synthesis method and photoionization dataset for organic hydroperoxides are useful for studying the chemistry of hydroperoxides and the reaction kinetics of the hydroperoxy radicals and for developing and evaluating kinetic models for the atmospheric autoxidation and combustion autoxidation of the organic compounds.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/689841/1/pnas.2220131120.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/689841/pnas.2220131120.pdf.txt,2023-03-01T09:20:10

Tundra lakes dynamics is a robust indicator of global climate processes, and is still not well understood. Satellite data, particularly, from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a suitable tool for tundra lakes recognition and monitoring of their changes. However, manual analysis of lake boundaries can be slow and inefficient; therefore, reliable automated algorithms are required. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage approach, comprising instance deep-learning-based segmentation by U-Net, followed by semantic segmentation based on a watershed algorithm for separating touching and overlapping lakes. Implementation of this concept is essential for accurate sizes and shapes estimation of an individual lake. Here, we evaluated the performance of the proposed approach on lakes, manually extracted from tens of C-band SAR images from Sentinel-1, which were collected in the Yamal Peninsula and Alaska areas in the summer months of 2015–2022. An accuracy of 0.73, in terms of the Jaccard similarity index, was achieved. The lake’s perimeter, area and fractal sizes were estimated, based on the algorithm framework output from hundreds of SAR images. It was recognized as lognormal distributed. The evaluation of the results indicated the efficiency of the proposed approach for accurate automatic estimation of tundra lake shapes and sizes, and its potential to be used for further studies on tundra lake dynamics, in the context of global climate change, aimed at revealing new factors that could cause the planet to warm or cool.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Published,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/689840/1/remotesensing-15-01298.pdf,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/689840/remotesensing-15-01298.pdf.txt,2023-03-01T09:20:10
